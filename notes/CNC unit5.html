Chapter‐1 Intruders</br>
• Intrusion detection system
Intruders</br>
• significant issue for networked systems is
hostile or unwanted access</br>
• either via network or local</br>
• can identify classes of intruders:</br>
– masquerader
– misfeasor
– clandestine user
• varying levels of competence
Intruders</br>
• clearly a growing publicized problem
– from “Wily Hacker” in 1986/87
– to clearly escalating CERT stats</br>
• may seem benign, but still cost resources</br>
• may use compromised system to launch other
attacks</br>
• awareness of intruders has led to the
development of CERTs
Intrusion Techniques</br>
• aim to gain access and/or increase privileges
on a system</br>
• basic attack methodology
– target acquisition and information gathering
– initial access
– privilege escalation
– covering tracks</br>
• key goal often is to acquire passwords</br>
• so then exercise access rights of owner
Password Guessing</br>
• one of the most common attacks</br>
• attacker knows a login (from email/web page etc)</br>
• then attempts to guess password for it</br>
– defaults, short passwords, common word searches
– user info (variations on names, birthday, phone, common
words/interests)
– exhaustively searching all possible passwords</br>
• check by login or against stolen password file</br>
• success depends on password chosen by user</br>
• surveys show many users choose poorly</br>
Password Capture</br>
• another attack involves password capture</br>
– watching over shoulder as password is entered
– using a trojan horse program to collect
– monitoring an insecure network login
• eg. telnet, FTP, web, email</br>
– extracting recorded info after successful login (web
history/cache, last number dialed etc)</br>
• using valid login/password can impersonate user</br>
• users need to be educated to use suitable</br>
precautions/countermeasures
Intrusion Detection</br>
• inevitably will have security failures</br>
• so need also to detect intrusions so can</br>
– block if detected quickly
– act as deterrent
– collect info to improve security</br>
• assume intruder will behave differently to a
legitimate user</br>
– but will have imperfect distinction between
Approaches to Intrusion
Detection</br>
• statistical anomaly detection
– threshold</br>
– profile based</br>
• rule‐based detection
– anomaly
– penetration identification
Audit Records</br>
• fundamental tool for intrusion detection
• native audit records</br>
– part of all common multi‐user O/S
– already present for use
– may not have info wanted in desired form</br>
• detection‐specific audit records
– created specifically to collect wanted info
– at cost of additional overhead on system
Statistical Anomaly Detection</br>
• threshold detection
– count occurrences of specific event over time
– if exceed reasonable value assume intrusion
– alone is a crude & ineffective detector</br>
• profile based
– characterize past behavior of users
– detect significant deviations from this
– profile usually multi‐parameter
Audit Record Analysis</br>
• foundation of statistical approaches</br>
• analyze records to get metrics over time
– counter, gauge, interval timer, resource use</br>
• use various tests on these to determine if
current behavior is acceptable
– mean & standard deviation, multivariate, markov
process, time series, operational</br>
• key advantage is no prior knowledge used
Rule‐Based Intrusion Detection</br>
• observe events on system & apply rules to
decide if activity is suspicious or not</br>
• rule‐based anomaly detection
– analyze historical audit records to identify usage
patterns & auto‐generate rules for them
– then observe current behavior & match against
rules to see if conforms
– like statistical anomaly detection does not require
prior knowledge of security flaws
Rule‐Based Intrusion Detection</br>
• rule‐based penetration identification
– uses expert systems technology
– with rules identifying known penetration,
weakness patterns, or suspicious behavior
– compare audit records or states against rules
– rules usually machine & O/S specific
– rules are generated by experts who interview &
codify knowledge of security admins
– quality depends on how well this is done
Base‐Rate Fallacy</br>
• practically an intrusion detection system
needs to detect a substantial percentage of
intrusions with few false alarms
– if too few intrusions detected ‐> false security
– if too many false alarms ‐> ignore / waste time</br>
• this is very hard to do</br>
• existing systems seem not to have a good
record</br>
Distributed Intrusion Detection</br>
• traditional focus is on single systems</br>
• but typically have networked systems</br>
• more effective defense has these working
together to detect intrusions</br>
• issues</br>
– dealing with varying audit record formats
– integrity & confidentiality of networked data
– centralized or decentralized architecture
Distributed Intrusion
Detection ‐ Architecture
Distributed Intrusion
Detection – Agent
Implementation
Honeypots</br>
• decoy systems to lure attackers
– away from accessing critical systems
– to collect information of their activities
– to encourage attacker to stay on system so
administrator can respond</br>
• are filled with fabricated information</br>
• instrumented to collect detailed information
on attackers activities</br>
• single or multiple networked systems</br>
• cf IETF Intrusion Detection WG standards
Summary</br>
• have considered:
– problem of intrusion
– intrusion detection (statistical & rule‐based)
– password management</br>

Chapter‐2 Viruses and Other
Malicious Content</font></br>
<br>
• Virus and related threats – Countermeasures
Viruses and Other
Malicious Content</br>
• computer viruses have got a lot of publicity</br>
• one of a family of malicious software</br>
• effects usually obvious</br>
• have figured in news reports, fiction, movies
(often exaggerated)</br>
• getting more attention than deserve</br>
• are a concern though
Malicious Software
Backdoor or Trapdoor
</br>• secret entry point into a program
• allows those who know access bypassing usual
security procedures</br>
• have been commonly used by developers</br>
• a threat when left in production programs
allowing exploited by attackers</br>
• very hard to block in O/S</br>
• requires good s/w development & update
Logic Bomb</br>
• one of oldest types of malicious software</br>
• code embedded in legitimate program</br>
• activated when specified conditions met
– eg presence/absence of some file
– particular date/time
– particular user</br>
• when triggered typically damage system
– modify/delete files/disks, halt machine, etc
Trojan Horse</br>
• program with hidden side‐effects</br>
• which is usually superficially attractive
– eg game, s/w upgrade etc</br>
• when run performs some additional tasks
– allows attacker to indirectly gain access they do not have
directly</br>
• often used to propagate a virus/worm or install a
backdoor</br>
• or simply to destroy data
Zombie</br>
• program which secretly takes over another
networked computer</br>
• then uses it to indirectly launch attacks</br>
• often used to launch distributed denial of
service (DDoS) attacks</br>
• exploits known flaws in network systems
Viruses</br>
• a piece of self‐replicating code attached to
some other code
– cf biological virus</br>
• both propagates itself & carries a payload
– carries code to make copies of itself
– as well as code to perform some covert task
Virus Operation</br>
• virus phases:
– dormant – waiting on trigger event
– propagation – replicating to programs/disks
– triggering – by event to execute payload
– execution – of payload</br>
• details usually machine/OS specific
– exploiting features/weaknesses
Virus Structure
program V :=
{goto main;
1234567;
subroutine infect‐executable := {loop:
file := get‐random‐executable‐file;
if (first‐line‐of‐file = 1234567) then goto loop
else prepend V to file; }
subroutine do‐damage := {whatever damage is to be done}
subroutine trigger‐pulled := {return true if condition holds}
main: main‐program := {infect‐executable;
if trigger‐pulled then do‐damage;
goto next;}
next:
}
Types of Viruses</br>
• can classify on basis of how they attack</br>
• parasitic virus</br>
• memory‐resident virus</br>
• boot sector virus</br>
• stealth</br>
• polymorphic virus</br>
• metamorphic viruses
Macro Virus</br>
• macro code attached to some data file</br>
• interpreted by program using file
– eg Word/Excel macros
– esp. using auto command & command macros</br>
• code is now platform independent</br>
• is a major source of new viral infections</br>
• blur distinction between data and program files</br>
• classic trade‐off: "ease of use" vs "security”</br>
• have improving security in Word etc</br>
• are no longer dominant virus threat
Email Virus</br>
• spread using email with attachment
containing a macro virus
– cf Melissa</br>
• triggered when user opens attachment</br>
• or worse even when mail viewed by using
scripting features in mail agent</br>
• hence propagate very quickly</br>
• usually targeted at Microsoft Outlook mail
agent & Word/Excel documents</br>
• need better O/S & application security
Worms</br>
• replicating but not infecting program
</br>• typically spreads over a network
– cf Morris Internet Worm in 1988
–</br> led to creation of CERTs
• using users distributed privileges or by exploiting
system vulnerabilities</br>
• widely used by hackers to create zombie PC's,
subsequently used for further attacks, esp DoS</br>
• major issue is lack of security of permanently
connected systems, esp PC's</br>
Worm Operation
• worm phases like those of viruses:
– dormant
– propagation</br>
• search for other systems to infect</br>
• establish connection to target remote system</br>
• replicate self onto remote system</br>
– triggering
– execution
Morris Worm</br>
• best known classic worm</br>
• released by Robert Morris in 1988</br>
• targeted Unix systems</br>
• using several propagation techniques
– simple password cracking of local pw file
– exploit bug in finger daemon
– exploit debug trapdoor in sendmail daemon</br>
• if any attack succeeds then replicated self
Recent Worm Attacks</br>
</br>• new spate of attacks from mid‐2001
</br>• Code Red ‐ used MS IIS bug
– probes random IPs for systems running IIS
– had trigger time for denial‐of‐service attack
– 2nd wave infected 360000 servers in 14 hours
</br>• Code Red 2 ‐ installed backdoor
</br>• Nimda ‐ multiple infection mechanisms
</br>• SQL Slammer ‐ attacked MS SQL server
</br>• Sobig.f ‐ attacked open proxy servers
</br>• Mydoom ‐ mass email worm + backdoor
Worm Techology
</br>• multiplatform
</br>• multiexploit
</br>• ultrafast spreading
</br>• polymorphic
</br>• metamorphic
</br>• transport vehicles
</br>• zero‐day exploit
Virus Countermeasures
</br>• best countermeasure is prevention
</br>• but in general not possible
</br>• hence need to do one or more of:
– detection ‐ of viruses in infected system
– identification ‐ of specific infecting virus
– removeal ‐ restoring system to clean state
Anti‐Virus Software
</br>• first‐generation
– scanner uses virus signature to identify virus
– or change in length of programs
</br>• second‐generation
– uses heuristic rules to spot viral infection
– or uses crypto hash of program to spot changes
</br>• third‐generation
– memory‐resident programs identify virus by actions
</br>• fourth‐generation
– packages with a variety of antivirus techniques
– eg scanning & activity traps, access‐controls
</br>• arms race continues
Advanced Anti‐Virus
Techniques
</br>• generic decryption
– use CPU simulator to check program signature &
behavior before actually running it
</br>• digital immune system (IBM)
– general purpose emulation & virus detection
– any virus entering org is captured, analyzed,
detection/shielding created for it, removed
Digital Immune System
Behavior‐Blocking Software
</br>• integrated with host O/S
</br>• monitors program behavior in real‐time
– eg file access, disk format, executable mods,
system settings changes, network access
</br>• for possibly malicious actions
– if detected can block, terminate, or seek ok
</br>• has advantage over scanners
</br>• but malicious code runs before detection
Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS)
</br>• Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
form a significant security threat
</br>• making networked systems unavailable
</br>• by flooding with useless traffic
</br>• using large numbers of “zombies”
</br>• growing sophistication of attacks
</br>• defense technologies struggling to cope
Distributed Denial of Service
Attacks (DDoS)
Contructing the DDoS Attack Network
</br>• must infect large number of zombies
</br>• needs:
1. software to implement the DDoS attack</br>
2. an unpatched vulnerability on many systems</br>
3. scanning strategy to find vulnerable systems
– random, hit
list, topological, local subnet</br>
DDoS Countermeasures
• three broad lines of defense:</br>
</br>1. attack prevention & preemption (before)
</br>2. attack detection & filtering (during)
</br>3. attack source traceback & ident (after)
</br>• huge range of attack possibilities
</br>• hence evolving countermeasures
Summary
</br>• have considered:
– various malicious programs
– trapdoor, logic bomb, trojan horse, zombie
– viruses
– worms
– countermeasures
– distributed denial of service attacks</br>

<br><font size="5">Chapter 3 Firewalls</font></br>
<br>Introduction</font></br>
</br>• seen evolution of information systems
</br>• now everyone want to be on the Internet
</br>• and to interconnect networks
</br>• has persistent security concerns
– can’t easily secure every system in org
</br>• typically use a Firewall
</br>• to provide perimeter defence
</br>• as part of comprehensive security strategy
What is a Firewall?
</br>• a choke point of control and monitoring
</br>• interconnects networks with differing trust
</br>• imposes restrictions on network services
– only authorized traffic is allowed
</br>• auditing and controlling access
– can implement alarms for abnormal behavior
</br>• provide NAT & usage monitoring
• implement VPNs using IPSec</br>
</br>• must be immune to penetration
Firewall Limitations
</br>• cannot protect from attacks bypassing it
– eg sneaker net, utility modems, trusted
organisations, trusted services (eg SSL/SSH)
</br>• cannot protect against internal threats
– eg disgruntled or colluding employees
</br>• cannot protect against transfer of all virus
infected programs or files
– because of huge range of O/S & file types
Firewalls – Packet Filters
• simplest, fastest firewall component</br>
• foundation of any firewall system
</br>• examine each IP packet (no context) and
permit or deny according to rules</br>
• hence restrict access to services (ports)</br>
• possible default policies</br>
– that not expressly permitted is prohibited
– that not expressly prohibited is permitted
Firewalls – Packet Filters
Firewalls – Packet Filters
Attacks on Packet Filters</br>
• IP address spoofing
– fake source address to be trusted
– add filters on router to block</br>
• source routing attacks
– attacker sets a route other than default
– block source routed packets</br>
• tiny fragment attacks
– split header info over several tiny packets
– either discard or reassemble before check
Firewalls – Stateful
Packet Filters</br>
• traditional packet filters do not examine
higher layer context
– ie matching return packets with outgoing flow</br>
• stateful packet filters address this need</br>
• they examine each IP packet in context
– keep track of client‐server sessions
– check each packet validly belongs to one
• hence are better able to detect bogus packets
out of context
Firewalls ‐ Application
Level Gateway (or Proxy)</br>
• have application specific gateway / proxy
• has full access to protocol</br>
– user requests service from proxy
– proxy validates request as legal
– then actions request and returns result to user
– can log / audit traffic at application level</br>
• need separate proxies for each service
– some services naturally support proxying
– others are more problematic
Firewalls ‐ Application
Level Gateway (or Proxy)
Firewalls ‐ Circuit Level
Gateway
</br>• relays two TCP connections
</br>• imposes security by limiting which such
connections are allowed</br>
• once created usually relays traffic without
examining contents</br>
• typically used when trust internal users by
allowing general outbound connections</br>
• SOCKS is commonly used
Firewalls ‐ Circuit Level
Gateway
Bastion Host</br>
• highly secure host system</br>
• runs circuit / application level gateways</br>
• or provides externally accessible services</br>
• potentially exposed to "hostile" elements</br>
• hence is secured to withstand this</br>
– hardened O/S, essential services, extra auth
– proxies small, secure, independent, non‐privileged
• may support 2 or more net connections</br>
• may be trusted to enforce policy of trusted
separation between these net connections
Firewall Configurations

Firewall Configurations
Access Control
</br>• given system has identified a user
</br>• determine what resources they can access
</br>• general model is that of access matrix with
– subject ‐ active entity (user, process)
– object ‐ passive entity (file or resource)
– access right – way object can be accessed
</br>• can decompose by
– columns as access control lists
– rows as capability tickets
Access Control Matrix
Trusted Computer Systems
• information security is increasingly important
• have varying degrees of sensitivity of information
– cf military info classifications: confidential, secret etc
</br>• subjects (people or programs) have varying rights of
access to objects (information)
</br>• known as multilevel security
– subjects have maximum & current security level
– objects have a fixed security level classification</br>
• want to consider ways of increasing confidence in
systems to enforce these rights
Bell LaPadula (BLP) Model
</br>• one of the most famous security models
</br>• implemented as mandatory policies on system
</br>• has two key policies:
</br>• no read up (simple security property)
– a subject can only read/write an object if the current
security level of the subject dominates (>=) the
classification of the object
• no write down (*‐property)
– a subject can only append/write to an object if the current
security level of the subject is dominated by (<=) the
classification of the object
Reference Monitor
Evaluated Computer Systems
</br>• governments can evaluate IT systems
• against a range of standards:
– TCSEC, IPSEC and now Common Criteriva
</br>• define a number of “levels” of evaluation with
increasingly stringent checking</br>
• have published lists of evaluated products
– though aimed at government/defense use
– can be useful in industry also
Common Criteria</br>
• international initiative specifying security
requirements & defining evaluation criteria</br>
• incorporates earlier standards
– eg CSEC, ITSEC, CTCPEC (Canadian), Federal (US)</br>
• specifies standards for
– evaluation criteria
– methodology for application of criteria
– administrative procedures for evaluation, certification
and accreditation schemes
Common Criteria
• defines set of security requirements</br>
• have a Target Of Evaluation (TOE)</br>
• requirements fall in two categories
– functional
– assurance</br>
• both organised in classes of families &
components
Common Criteria Requirements</br>
• Functional Requirements
– security audit, crypto support, communications,
user data protection, identification &
authentication, security management, privacy,
protection of trusted security functions,
resource utilization, TOE access, trusted path</br>
• Assurance Requirements
– configuration management, delivery & operation,
development, guidance documents, life cycle
support, tests, vulnerability assessment, assurance
maintenance
Common Criteria
Common Criteria
Summary</br>
• have considered:
– firewalls
– types of firewalls
– configurations
– access control
– trusted systems
– common criteria</br>
