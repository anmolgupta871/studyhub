Risk Management

Q.1	What is Risk Projection?

Ans:	Risk Projection also called risk estimation, attempts to rate each risk on the basis of Probability and Consequences.

The risk drivers affecting each risk component are:

•	classified according to their impact category

•	potential consequences of each undetected software fault or unachieved project outcome are described


Q.2	What is Risk Management?

Ans: Risk Management can be defined as: “A logical process for identifying and analyzing leading to appropriate methods for handling and monitoring exposures to loss”.

Risk management deals with:
-	Systematic identification of an exposure to the risk of loss, &

-	Making decisions on the best methods for handling these exposures to minimize losses

Q.3	What is Risk Analysis with Risk Identification and Projection?

Ans:	Risk Analysis includes:

•	Risk identification
•	Risk projection
–   impact of risks/likelihood of risk actually happening

•	Risk assessment
–   what will change if risk becomes problem
•	Risk mana


Q.4	Explain RMMM? Give a brief overview of RMMM plan.

Ans:	RMMM is Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management An effective strategy must consider three issues:
-	risk mitigation/reduction/avoidance,

-	risk monitoring, and
-	risk management and contingency(emergency) planning

•	Risk Mitigation
–   proactive planning for risk avoidance
•	Risk Monitoring
–   assessing whether predicted risks occur or not
–   ensuring risk aversion steps are being properly applied
–   collect information for future risk analysis
–   determining which risks caused which problems

•	Risk Management
–   contingency planning

– actions to be taken in the event that mitigation steps have failed and the risk has become a live problem

Q.6  Explain Project Scheduling and Tracking?
Ans:

Software project scheduling is an activity that distributes estimated effort across the planed project duration by allocating the effort to specific software engineering tasks.

First, a macroscopic schedule is developed. Then, a detailed schedule is redefined for each entry in the macroscopic schedule. A Project schedule evolves over time.

Few guiding principles for software project scheduling are:

-	Compartmentalization

-	Interdependency
-	Time allocation
-	Effort allocation
-	Effort validation

-	Defined responsibilities
-	Defined outcomes
-	Defined milestones

Two well known project scheduling methods are:
-	Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
-	Critical Path Method (CPM)

Similarity between the two methods :

Both methods are driven by information developed in earlier project planning activities:

-	Estimates of effort
-	A decomposition of product function

-	The selection of the appropriate process model
-	The selection of project type and task set

Both methods allow a planner to do:

-	determine the critical path
-	time estimation
-	calculate boundary times for each task

Boundary times:
-	the earliest time and latest time to begin a task
-	the earliest time and latest time to complete a task
-	the total float.

Q.7	Explain Project Tracking?

Ans:	The project schedule provides a road map for a software project manager. It defines the tasks and milestones.

Several ways to track a project schedule:

-	Conducting periodic project status meeting

-	Evaluating the review results in the software process
-	Determine if formal project milestones have been accomplished
-	Compare actual start date to planned start date for each task

-	Informal meeting with practitioners


Quality Management


Q.1	Explain process and product quality

Ans:	Understanding, Modelling and Improving the Software Process is process improvement.

-	Process quality and product quality are closely related

-	A good process is usually required to produce a good product

-	For manufactured goods, process is the principal quality determinant

-	For design-based activity, other factors are also involved especially the capabilities of the designers

Principal product quality factors are as shown in fig 12.1.

Figure 12.1 Principal product quality factors

-	For large projects with average capabilities, the development process determines product quality

-	For small projects, the capabilities of the developers is the main determinant

-	The development technology is particularly significant for small projects

-	In all cases, if an unrealistic schedule is imposed then product quality will suffer


Q.2	What do you mean by Quality assurance and its standards?

Ans:	Quality assurance is establishing organisational procedures and standards for quality.

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Activities:

•	Prepares an SQA plan for a project

•	Participates in the development of the project's software process description

•	Reviews software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process

•	Audits designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process

•	Ensures that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure

•	Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management
•	Coordinates the control and management of change

•	Helps to collect and analyze software metrics


Standards:
-	Standards are the key to effective quality management

-	They may be international, national, organizational or project standards


-	Product standards define characteristics that all components should exhibit e.g. a common programming style

-	Process standards define how the software process should be enacted

Importance of standards:
-	Encapsulation of best practice- avoids repetition of past mistakes

-	Framework for quality assurance process - it involves checking standard compliance

-	Provide continuity - new staff can understand the organisation by understand the standards applied


Certification Standards:
1.	ISO 9000

2.	ISO 9001

Q.3	What is Quality planning?

Ans:	Quality planning is selecting applicable procedures and standards for a particular project and modify these as required.

-	A quality plan sets out the desired product qualities and how these are assessed and define the most significant quality attributes

-	It should define the quality assessment process

-	It should set out which organisational standards should be applied and, if necessary, define new standards

Quality plan structure:
-	Product introduction
-	Product plans

-	Process descriptions
-	Quality goals
-	Risks and risk management
-	Quality plans should be short, succinct documents

Q.4	What is Quality control?

Ans:	Quality control is ensuring that procedures and standards are followed by the software development team.

Quality Control :

•	Involves a series of inspections, reviews, and tests used throughout the software process

•	Ensures that each work product meets the requirements placed on it

•	Includes a feedback loop to the process that created the work product

•	Combines measurement and feedback in order to adjust the process when product specifications are not met

•	Requires all work products to have defined, measurable specifications to which practitioners may compare to the output of each process
