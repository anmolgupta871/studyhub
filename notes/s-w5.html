Software Testing and Cost Estimation
</br></br>
Q.1	Explain System testing.
</br>
Ans:	</font>System Testing is the assurance of proper working or execution of the developed system from user‟s perspective using formal procedure.

System Testing Process can be defined in the following steps (as shown in fig 11.1):</br>

a.	Function Testing: the system must perform functions specified in the requirements.
</br>
b.	Performance Testing: the system must satisfy security, precision, load and speed constrains specified in the requirements.
</br>
c.	Acceptance Testing: customers try the system to make sure that the system built is the system they had requested.
</br>
d.	Installation Testing: the software is deployed and tested in the production environment.

Q.2	Explain Component testing.
</br>
Ans:	</font>Component testing is also known as Unit testing. It refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code, usually at the

function level. In an object-oriented environment, this is usually at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors. These types of tests are usually written by developers as they work on code (white-box testing), to ensure that the specific function is working as expected. Unit testing alone cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but rather is used to assure that the building blocks of the software work independently of each other.

Q.3	Explain Test case design.
</br>
Ans:</font>	Test Case design includes the designing of test cases. A Test Case is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A test case is a detailed procedure that fully tests a feature or an aspect of a feature. Whereas the test plan describes what to test, a test case describes how to perform a particular test. You need to develop a test case for each test listed in the test plan.

A test case includes:
</br>
The purpose of the test.
</br>
Special hardware requirements, such as a modem.
Special software requirements, such as a tool.
Specific setup or configuration requirements.
A description of how to perform the test.
</br>
The expected results or success criteria for the test.
</br>
Tips for writing test cases:
</br>
1.	Test Cases need to be simple and transparent
</br>
2.	Create Test Case with End User in mind
</br>
3.	Avoid test case repetition
</br>
4.	Do not Assume
</br>
5.	Test Cases must be identifiable
</br>
6.	Implement Testing Techniques
</br>
7.	Peer Review

Q.4	What is Test automation?
</br>
Ans:</font>	In software testing, test automation is the use of

special software (separate from the software being tested) to control the

execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate previous repetitive but necessary testing in a formalized testing process already in place, or add additional testing that would be difficult to perform manually.

</br></br>
Q.5	What do you mean by Software productivity?
</br>
Ans:</font>	In standard economic terms, productivity is the ratio between the amount of goods or services produced and the labor or expense that goes into producing them. Software productivity is the ratio between the amount of software produced to the labor and expense of producing it. Some of the methods of measuring software productivity are Function Point Analysis, Constructive Cost Modeling, and Cyclomatic Complexity.
</br></br><font size="5">                          
Q.6	What is Algorithmic cost modeling.
</br>
Ans:	</font>It is formulaic approach based on historical cost information and which is generally based on the size of the software. In algorithmic cost modeling, cost is estimated as a mathematical function of product, project and process attributes whose values are estimated by project managers.
</br>
Effort = A x SizeB  x M

Where, A=organisation-dependent constant,

B= disproportionate effort for large projects
</br>
M=is a multiplier reflecting product, process and people attributes. (Most commonly used product attribute for cost estimation is code size)
 
Most	models	are	basically
 
similar
 
but
 
with
 
different values for A, B and M
 </br></br><font size="5">                          
Q.7	What do you mean by Project duration and staffing?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Managers are supposed to estimate the calendar time required to complete a project and the points when staff will be required. Calendar time can be estimated using a COCOMO 2 formula
</br>
TDEV = 3 x (PM)(0.33+0.2*(B-1.01))
Where,
</br>
PM = effort computation
B = exponent computed (E.g. B =1 for the early prototyping model)
</br>
Staffing includes the following facts:
</br>
The time requirement is independent of the number of people working on the project.
</br>
Staff required can‟t be computed by diving the development time by the required schedule
</br>
The number of people working on a project varies depending on the phase of the project

The more people who work on the project, the more total effort is usually required

A very rapid build-up of people often correlates with schedule slippage</br>
</br><font size="5">                          
Q.8	What is COCOMO?
</br>
Ans:	</font>COCOMO is Constructive Cost Model and it is an empirical model based on project experience. It is well-documented, „independent‟ model which is not tied to a specific software vendor.

COCOMO Versions
</br>1.	COCOMO 81” or COCOMO I (Base Model)
</br>
2.	Cocomo II (circa 2000) (Current Version)
</br>3.	Commercial take-offs
</br>
Costar (Softstarsystems.com)

Cost Xpert (CostXpert.com)
</br>
COCOMO I or COCOMO 81</br>
-	Proposed by B.W. Boehm in 1981</br>
-	Based on related data of 63 completed software projects.
</br>
-	Developed for Cost Estimation i.e. for Person-Months and Development Time from size estimation
</br>
-	It is a static model
</br>
COCOMO II MODEL</br>
-	Successor of COCOMO 81
</br>
-	Developed at University of Southern California in 1995 under the leadership of Dr. Barry Boehm
</br>
-	Based on 83 projects
</br>
-	COCOMO II takes into account new development processes, increased flexibility in software development, need for decision making with incomplete information and new data about projects.
</br>
-	Provides more support for estimating modern software development processes and an updated project database.
</br>
-	The need for the new model was raised due to updating and enhancement in dev. technology like desktop development, code reusability and the use of off-the-shelf software components.
</br>
-	COCOMO II models require sizing information. Three different sizing options are available as part of the model hierarchy i.e.
</br>
o  OP, object points, o FP, function points,
</br>o  LOC, lines of source code.

Quality Management

</br></br><font size="5">                          
Q.1	Explain process and product quality
</br>
Ans:	</font>Understanding, Modelling and Improving the Software Process is process improvement.
</br>
-	Process quality and product quality are closely related
</br>
-	A good process is usually required to produce a good product
</br>
-	For manufactured goods, process is the principal quality determinant
</br>
-	For design-based activity, other factors are also involved especially the capabilities of the designers
</br>
Principal product quality factors are as shown in fig 12.1.
</br>
Principal product quality factors
</br>
-	For large projects with average capabilities, the development process determines product quality
</br>
-	For small projects, the capabilities of the developers is the main determinant
</br>
-	The development technology is particularly significant for small projects
</br>
-	In all cases, if an unrealistic schedule is imposed then product quality will suffer

Q.2	What do you mean by Quality assurance and its standards?
</br>
Ans:</font>	Quality assurance is establishing organisational procedures and standards for quality.
</br>
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Activities:
</br>
•	Prepares an SQA plan for a project
</br>
•	Participates in the development of the project's software process description
</br>
•	Reviews software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process
</br>
•	Audits designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process
</br>
•	Ensures that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure
</br>
•	Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management

</br>•	Coordinates the control and management of change
</br>
•	Helps to collect and analyze software metrics
</br>
</br>
Standards:</br>
-	Standards are the key to effective quality management
</br>
-	They may be international, national, organizational or project standards

</br>
-	Product standards define characteristics that all components should exhibit e.g. a common programming style
</br>
-	Process standards define how the software process should be enacted
</br>
Importance of standards:</br>
-	Encapsulation of best practice- avoids repetition of past mistakes
</br>
-	Framework for quality assurance process - it involves checking standard compliance
</br>
-	Provide continuity - new staff can understand the organisation by understand the standards applied

</br>
Certification Standards:</br>
1.	ISO 9000
</br>
2.	ISO 9001
</br></br><font size="5">                          
Q.3	What is Quality planning?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Quality planning is selecting applicable procedures and standards for a particular project and modify these as required.

-	A quality plan sets out the desired product qualities and how these are assessed and define the most significant quality attributes
</br>
-	It should define the quality assessment process
</br>
-	It should set out which organisational standards should be applied and, if necessary, define new standards
</br>
Quality plan structure:</br>
-	Product introduction</br>
-	Product plans</br>

-	Process descriptions</br>
-	Quality goals</br>
-	Risks and risk management</br>
-	Quality plans should be short, succinct documents
</br></br><font size="5">                          
Q.4	What is Quality control?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Quality control is ensuring that procedures and standards are followed by the software development team.
</br>
Quality Control :</br>

•	Involves a series of inspections, reviews, and tests used throughout the software process
</br>
•	Ensures that each work product meets the requirements placed on it
</br>
•	Includes a feedback loop to the process that created the work product
</br>
•	Combines measurement and feedback in order to adjust the process when product specifications are not met
</br>
•	Requires all work products to have defined, measurable specifications to which practitioners may compare to the output of each process
</br>
