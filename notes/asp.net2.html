ASP.NET is an open-source[2] server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.
</br>
It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.
</br>
ASP.NET's successor is ASP.NET Core. It is a re-implementation of ASP.NET as a modular web framework, together with other frameworks like Entity Framework. The new framework uses the new open-source .NET Compiler Platform (codename "Roslyn") and is cross platform. ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages) have merged into a unified MVC 6.[3]
</br>

<br>
<font size="5">characterstics ASP.NET Web pages</font></br>
<br>, known officially as Web Forms,[4] are the main building blocks for application development in ASP.NET.[5] There are two basic methodologies for Web Forms, a web application format and a web site format.[6] Web applications need to be compiled before deployment, while web sites structures allows the user to copy the files directly to the server without prior compilation. Web forms are contained in files with a ".aspx" extension; these files typically contain static (X)HTML markup or component markup. The component markup can include server-side Web Controls and User Controls that have been defined in the framework or the web page. For example, a textbox component can be defined on a page as <asp:textbox id='myid' runat='server'>, which is rendered into a html input box. Additionally, dynamic code, which runs on the server, can be placed in a page within a block <% -- dynamic code -- %>, which is similar to other Web development technologies such as PHP, JSP, and ASP. With ASP.NET Framework 2.0, Microsoft introduced a new code-behind model that lets static text remain on the .aspx page, while dynamic code remains in an .aspx.vb or .aspx.cs or .aspx.fs file (depending on the programming language used).[7]

Code-behind model
Microsoft recommends dealing with dynamic program code by using the code-behind model, which places this code in a separate file or in a specially designated script tag. Code-behind files typically have names like "MyPage.aspx.cs" or "MyPage.aspx.vb" while the page file is MyPage.aspx (same filename as the page file (ASPX), but with the final extension denoting the page language). This practice is automatic in Visual Studio and other IDEs, though the user can change the code-behind page. Also, in the web application format, the pagename.aspx.cs is a partial class that is linked to the pagename.designer.cs file. The designer file is a file that is autogenerated from the ASPX page and allows the programmer to reference components in the ASPX page from the CS page without having to declare them manually, as was necessary in ASP.NET versions before version 2.[8] When using this style of programming, the developer writes code to respond to different events, such as the page being loaded, or a control being clicked, rather than a procedural walkthrough of the document.

ASP.NET's code-behind model marks a departure from Classic ASP in that it encourages developers to build applications with separation of presentation and content in mind. In theory, this would allow a Web designer, for example, to focus on the design markup with less potential for disturbing the programming code that drives it. This is similar to the separation of the controller from the view in model–view–controller (MVC) frameworks.

Directives
A directive is a special instruction on how ASP.NET should process the page. The most common directive is <%@ Page %>, which can specify many attributes used by the ASP.NET page parser and compiler.
</br>User controls are encapsulations of sections of page sections that are registered and used as controls in ASP.NET

Custom controls
Programmers can also build custom controls for ASP.NET applications. Unlike user controls, these controls do not have an ASCX markup file, having all their code compiled into a dynamic link library (DLL) file. Such custom controls can be used across multiple Web applications and Visual Studio 2013 projects.

Rendering technique
.NET uses a "visited composites" rendering technique. During compilation, the template (.aspx) file is compiled into initialization code that builds a control tree (the composite) representing the original template. Literal text goes into instances of the Literal control class, and server controls are represented by instances of a specific control class. The initialization code is combined with user-written code (usually by the assembly of multiple partial classes) and results in a class specific for the page. The page doubles as the root of the control tree.

Actual requests for the page are processed through a number of steps. First, during the initialization steps, an instance of the page class is created and the initialization code is executed. This produces the initial control tree, which is now typically manipulated by the methods of the page in the following steps. As each node in the tree is a control represented as an instance of a class, the code may change the tree structure as well as manipulate the properties/methods of the individual nodes. Finally, during the rendering step a visitor is used to visit every node in the tree, asking each node to render itself using the methods of the visitor. The resulting HTML output is sent to the client.

After the request has been processed, the instance of the page class is discarded and with it the entire control tree. This is a source of confusion among novice ASP.NET programmers who rely on the class instance members that are lost with every page request/response cycle.

State management
ASP.NET applications are hosted by a Web server and are accessed using the stateless HTTP protocol. As such, if an application uses stateful interaction, it has to implement state management on its own. ASP.NET provides various functions for state management. Conceptually, Microsoft treats "state" as GUI state. Problems may arise if an application must track "data state"; for example, a finite-state machine that may be in a transient state between requests (lazy evaluation) or takes a long time to initialize. State management in ASP.NET pages with authentication can make Web scraping difficult or impossible.

Application
Application state is held by a collection of shared user-defined variables. These are set and initialized when the Application_OnStart event fires on the loading of the first instance of the application and are available until the last instance exits. Application state variables are accessed using the Applications collection, which provides a wrapper for the application state. Application state variables are identified by name.[10] Application is state management.

Session state
Server-side session state is held by a collection of user-defined session variables that are persistent during a user session. These variables, accessed using the Session collection, are unique to each session instance. The variables can be set to be automatically destroyed after a defined time of inactivity even if the session does not end. Client-side user session is maintained by either a cookie or by encoding the session ID in the URL itself.[10]

ASP.NET supports three modes of persistence for server-side session variables:[10]
</br>
In-process mode
The session variables are maintained within the ASP.NET process. This is the fastest way; however, in this mode the variables are destroyed when the ASP.NET process is recycled or shut down.
State server mode
ASP.NET runs a separate Windows service that maintains the state variables. Because state management happens outside the ASP.NET process, and because the ASP.NET engine accesses data using .NET Remoting, ASPState is slower than In-Process. This mode allows an ASP.NET application to be load-balanced and scaled across multiple servers. Because the state management service runs independently of ASP.NET, the session variables can persist across ASP.NET process shutdowns. However, since session state server runs as one instance, it is still one point of failure for session state. The session-state service cannot be load-balanced, and there are restrictions on types that can be stored in a session variable.
SQL Server mode
State variables are stored in a database, allowing session variables to be persisted across ASP.NET process shutdowns. The main advantage of this mode is that it allows the application to balance load on a server cluster, sharing sessions between servers. This is the slowest method of session state management in ASP.NET.
ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. The server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.

Alternatives to session state include the following:

Application state, which stores variables that can be accessed by all users of an ASP.NET application.
Profile properties, which persists user values in a data store without expiring them.
ASP.NET caching, which stores values in memory that is available to all ASP.NET applications.
View state, which persists values in a page.
Cookies.
The query string and fields on an HTML form that are available from an HTTP request.
View state
View state refers to the page-level state management mechanism, utilized by the HTML pages emitted by ASP.NET applications to maintain the state of the Web form controls and widgets. The state of the controls is encoded and sent to the server at every form submission in a hidden field known as __VIEWSTATE. The server sends back the variable so that, when the page is re-rendered, the controls render at their last state. At the server side, the application may change the viewstate, if the processing requires a change of state of any control. The states of individual controls are decoded at the server, and are available for use in ASP.NET pages using the ViewState collection.[11]

The main use for this is to preserve form information across postbacks. View state is turned on by default and normally serializes the data in every control on the page regardless of whether it is actually used during a postback. This behavior can (and should) be modified, however, as View state can be disabled on a per-control, per-page, or server-wide basis.

Developers need to be wary of storing sensitive or private information in the View state of a page or control, as the base64 string containing the view state data can easily be de-serialized. By default, View state does not encrypt the __VIEWSTATE value. Encryption can be enabled on a server-wide (and server-specific) basis, allowing for a certain level of security to be maintained.[12]

Server-side caching
ASP.NET offers a "Cache" object that is shared across the application and can also be used to store various objects. The "Cache" object holds the data only for a specified amount of time and is automatically cleaned after the session time-limit elapses.

Other
Other means of state management that are supported by ASP.NET are cookies, caching, and the query string.

Template engine
When first released, ASP.NET lacked a template engine. Because the .NET Framework is object-oriented and allows for inheritance, many developers would define a new base class that inherits from "System.Web.UI.Page", write methods there that render HTML, and then make the pages in their application inherit from this new class. While this allows for common elements to be reused across a site, it adds complexity and mixes source code with markup. Furthermore, this method can only be visually tested by running the application – not while designing it. Other developers have used include files and other tricks to avoid having to implement the same navigation and other elements in every page.

ASP.NET 2.0 introduced the concept of master pages, which allow for template-based page development. A Web application can have one or more master pages, which, beginning with ASP.NET 2.0, can be nested.[13] Master templates have place-holder controls, called ContentPlaceHolders to denote where the dynamic content goes, as well as HTML and JavaScript shared across child pages.

Child pages use those ContentPlaceHolder controls, which must be mapped to the place-holder of the master page that the content page is populating. The rest of the page is defined by the shared parts of the master page, much like a mail merge in a word processor. All markup and server controls in the content page must be placed within the ContentPlaceHolder control.

When a request is made for a content page, ASP.NET merges the output of the content page with the output of the master page, and sends the output to the user.

The master page remains fully accessible to the content page. This means that the content page may still manipulate headers, change title, configure caching etc. If the master page exposes public properties or methods (e.g., for setting copyright notices) the content page can use these as well.

Other files
</br>
<font size="5">
Other file extensions associated with different versions of ASP.NET include:
</font></br>
Extension	Introduced in version	Description
</br>asax	1.0	This is the global application file.You can use this file to define global variables (Variable that can be accessed from any Web page in the Web application.) It is mostly used to define the overall application event related to application & session object.Global.asax, used for application-level logic[14]
</br>ascx	1.0	User Control, used for User Control files logic[15]
</br>ashx	1.0	Custom HTTP handlers do not have a user interface.
</br>asmx	1.0	Web service pages. From version 2.0 a Code behind page of an asmx file is placed into the app_code folder.
</br>aspx	1.0	An ASP.NET Web Forms page that can contain Web controls and presentation and business logic. 
</br>axd	1.0	When enabled in web.config requesting trace.axd outputs application-level tracing. Also used for the special webresource.axd handler, which allows control/component developers to package a component/control complete with images, script, css etc. for deployment in one file (an 'assembly')
</br>browser	2.0	Browser capabilities files stored in XML format; introduced in version 2.0. ASP.NET 2 includes many of these by default, to support common Web browsers. These specify which browsers have which abilities, so that ASP.NET 2 can automatically customize and optimize its output accordingly. Special .browser files are available for free download to handle, for instance, the W3C Validator, so that it properly shows standards-compliant pages as being standards-compliant. Replaces the harder-to-use BrowserCaps section that was in machine.config and could be overridden in web.config in ASP.NET 1.x.
</br>config	1.0	web.config is the only file in a specific Web application to use this extension by default (machine.config similarly affects the entire Web server and all applications on it), however ASP.NET provides facilities to create and consume other config files. These are stored in XML format.
</br>cs/vb/fs	1.0	Code files (cs indicates C#, vb indicates Visual Basic, fs indicates F#). Code behind files (see above) predominantly have the extension ".aspx.cs" or ".aspx.vb" for the two most common languages. Other code files (often containing common "library" classes) can also exist in the Web folders with the cs/vb extension. In ASP.NET 2 these should be placed inside the App_Code folder where they are dynamically compiled and available to the whole application.
</br>cshtml	4.1	Views (mixed C# and HTML using Razor syntax)
</br>dbml	3.5	LINQ to SQL data classes file
</br>edmx	3.5	ADO.NET Entity Framework model
</br>master	2.0	Master page file. Default file name is Master1.master
</br>resx	1.0	Resource files for internationalization and localization. Resource files can be global (e.g., messages) or local, which means specific for one aspx or ascx file.
</br>sitemap	2.0	Sitemap configuration files. Default file name is web.sitemap
</br>skin	2.0	Theme skin files.
</br>svc	3.0	Windows Communication Foundation service file
</br>vbhtml	4.1	Views (mixed VB and HTML using Razor syntax)
Directory structure
In general, the ASP.NET directory structure can be determined by the developer's preferences. Apart from a few reserved directory names, the site can span any number of directories. The structure is typically reflected directly in the URLs. Although ASP.NET provides means for intercepting the request at any point during processing, the developer is not forced to funnel requests through a central application or front controller.
</br>
The special directory names (from ASP.NET 2.0 on) are:[16]
</br>
App_Code 
This is the "raw code" directory. The ASP.NET server automatically compiles files (and subdirectories) in this folder into an assembly accessible in the code of every page of the site. App_Code is typically used for data access abstraction code, model code and business code. Also any site-specific http handlers and modules and Web service implementation go in this directory. As an alternative to using App_Code the developer may opt to provide a separate assembly with precompiled code.
App_Data 
The App_Data ASP.NET Directory is the default directory for any database used by the ASP.NET Website. These databases might include Access (mdb) files or SQL Server (mdf) files. The App_Data is the only directory with Write Access enabled for the ASP.NET web application.:[17]
App_GlobalResources 
Holds resx files with localized resources available to every page of the site. This is where the ASP.NET developer typically stores localized messages etc. used on more than one page.
App_LocalResources 
E.g., a file called CheckOut.aspx.fr-FR.resx holds localized resources for the French version of the CheckOut.aspx page. When the UI culture is set to French, ASP.NET automatically finds and uses this file for localization.
App_Offline.htm 
A file (not a directory) that disables the application by returning the contents of the file for any application request.
App_Themes 
Adds a folder that holds files related to themes, which is a new ASP.NET feature that helps ensure a consistent appearance throughout a Web site and makes it easier to change the Web site's appearance when necessary.
App_WebReferences 
holds discovery files and WSDL files for references to Web services to be consumed in the site.
Bin 
Contains compiled code (.dll files) for controls, components, or other code that you want to reference in your application. Any classes represented by code in the Bin folder are automatically referenced in your application.
Performance
ASP.NET aims for performance benefits over other script-based technologies (including Classic ASP) by compiling the server-side code the first time it is used to one or more DLL files on the Web server. These dll files or assemblies contain Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) for running within the common language runtime; this provides a performance boost over pure scripted languages and is similar to the approach used by Python and not dissimilar to JavaServer Pages.[18] This compilation happens automatically the first time a page is requested (which means the developer need not perform a separate compilation step for pages).
</br>
This feature provides the ease of development offered by scripting languages with the performance benefits of a compiled binary. However, the compilation might cause a noticeable but short delay to the user when the newly edited page is first requested from the Web server, but not again unless the requested page updates further.

The ASPX and other resource files are placed in a virtual host on an Internet Information Services server (or other compatible ASP.NET servers; see Other implementations, below). The first time a client requests a page, the .NET Framework parses and compiles the file(s) into a .NET assembly and sends the response; subsequent requests are served from the DLL files. By default ASP.NET compiles the entire site in batches of 1000 files upon first request. If the compilation delay is causing problems, the batch size or the compilation strategy may be tweaked.

Developers can also choose to pre-compile their "codebehind" files before deployment, using Microsoft Visual Studio, eliminating the need for just-in-time compilation in a production environment.[19] This also eliminates the need of having the source code on the Web server. It also supports pre-compile text.

Extensions
Microsoft has released some extension frameworks that plug into ASP.NET and extend its functionality. Some of them are:
</br>
ASP.NET Handler
</br>Are components that implement the System.Web.IHttpHandler interface. Unlike ASP.NET Pages, they have no HTML-markup file, no events and other supporting. All they have is a code-file (written in any .NET-compatible language) that writes some data to the server HTTP response. HTTP handlers are similar to ISAPI extensions.
ASP.NET AJAX
</br>An extension with both client-side as well as server-side components for writing ASP.NET pages that incorporate Ajax functionality.
ASP.NET MVC
</br>A framework extension to author ASP.NET pages using the model–view–controller (MVC) architecture.
ASP.NET Razor
</br>A Web Pages view alternative to Web Forms designed for use with MVC since release 3.
ASP.NET Dynamic Data
</br>A scaffolding extension to build data driven web applications
ASP.NET Web API
</br>An HTTP API framework for exposing web services.
ASP.NET SignalR
</br>A real-time communications framework for bi-directional communication between client and server.
ASP.NET compared with Classic ASP
</br>ASP.NET WebForms simplifies developers' transition from Windows application development to Web development by offering the ability to build pages composed of controls similar to a Windows user interface. A Web control, such as a button or label, functions in very much the same way as its Windows counterparts: code can assign its properties and respond to its events. Controls know how to render themselves: whereas Windows controls draw themselves to the screen, web controls produce segments of HTML and JavaScript that form parts of the resulting page sent to the end-user's browser.

ASP.NET WebForms encourages the programmer to develop applications using an event-driven GUI model, rather than in conventional Web-scripting environments like ASP and PHP.[20] The framework combines existing technologies such as JavaScript with internal components like "ViewState" to bring persistent (inter-request) state to the inherently stateless Web environment.
</br>
Other differences compared to Classic ASP are:
</br>
Compiled code means applications run faster with more design-time errors trapped at the development stage.
Significantly improved run-time error handling, making use of exception handling using try-catch blocks.
Similar metaphors to Microsoft Windows applications such as controls and events.</br>
An extensive set of controls and class libraries, as well as user-defined controls, </br>allow the rapid building of applications. Layout of these controls on a page is easier because most of it can be done visually in most editors.
ASP.NET uses the multi-language abilities of the .NET Common Language Runtime, </br>allowing Web pages to be coded in VB.NET, C#, J#, Delphi.NET etc.
Ability to cache the whole page or just parts of it to improve performance.</br>
Ability to use the code-behind development model to separate business logic from presentation.</br>
Ability to use true object-oriented design for programming pages and controls</br>
If an ASP.NET application leaks memory, </br>the ASP.NET runtime unloads the AppDomain hosting the erring application and reloads the application in a new AppDomain.
Session state in ASP.NET can be saved in a Microsoft SQL Server database or in a separate process running on the same machine as the Web server or on a different machine. That way session values are not lost when the Web server is reset or the ASP.NET worker process is recycled.
Versions of ASP.NET prior to 2.0 were criticized for their lack of standards compliance. The generated HTML and JavaScript sent to the client browser would not always validate against W3C/ECMA standards. In addition, the framework's browser detection feature sometimes incorrectly identified Web browsers other than Microsoft's own Internet Explorer as "downlevel" and returned HTML/JavaScript to these clients with some of the features removed, or sometimes crippled or broken. In version 2.0 however, all controls generate valid HTML 4.0, XHTML 1.0 (the default) or XHTML 1.1 output, depending on the site configuration. Detection of standards-compliant Web browsers is more robust and support for Cascading Style Sheets is more extensive.
Web Server Controls: these are controls introduced by ASP.NET WebForms for providing the UI for the Web form. These controls are state managed controls and are WYSIWYG controls.
IIS integrated pipeline
On IIS 6.0 and lower, pages written using different versions of the ASP framework cannot share session state without the use of third-party libraries. This does not apply to ASP.NET and ASP applications running side by side on IIS 7. With IIS 7.0, modules may be run in an integrated pipeline that allows modules written in any language to be executed for any request.[21]

</br>
  <font size="5"> Understanding ASP.NET Controls</font></br>
<br>Controls are small building blocks of the graphical user interface, which include text boxes, buttons, check boxes, list boxes, labels, and numerous other tools. Using these tools, the users can enter data, make selections and indicate their preferences.

Controls are also used for structural jobs, like validation, data access, security, creating master pages, and data manipulation.
</br>
ASP.NET uses five types of web controls, which are:
</br>
HTML controls</br>
HTML Server controls</br>
ASP.NET Server controls</br>
ASP.NET Ajax Server controls</br>
User controls and custom controls</br>
ASP.NET server controls are the primary controls used in ASP.NET. These controls can be grouped into the following categories:
</br>
Validation controls - These are used to validate user input and they work by running client-side script.
</br>
Data source controls - These controls provides data binding to different data sources.
</br>
Data view controls - These are various lists and tables, which can bind to data from data sources for displaying.
</br>
Personalization controls - These are used for personalization of a page according to the user preferences, based on user information.
</br>
Login and security controls - These controls provide user authentication.
</br>
Master pages - These controls provide consistent layout and interface throughout the application.
</br>
Navigation controls - These controls help in navigation. For example, menus, tree view etc.
</br>
Rich controls - These controls implement special features. For example, AdRotator, FileUpload, and Calendar control.
</br>
The syntax for using server controls is:

<asp:controlType  ID ="ControlID" runat="server" Property1=value1  [Property2=value2] /></br>
In addition, visual studio has the following features, to help produce in error-free coding:
</br>
Dragging and dropping of controls in design view
IntelliSense feature that displays and auto-completes the properties
The properties window to set the property values directly
Properties of the Server Controls</br>
ASP.NET server controls with a visual aspect are derived from the WebControl class and inherit all the properties, events, and methods of this class.
</br>
The WebControl class itself and some other server controls that are not visually rendered are derived from the System.Web.UI.Control class. For example, PlaceHolder control or XML control.
</br>
ASP.Net server controls inherit all properties, events, and methods of the WebControl and System.Web.UI.Control class.

<br>Web Servers in Visual Studio for ASP.NET Web Projects
Other Versions 
When you develop web projects in Visual Studio, you need a web server to test or run them. Visual Studio lets you test with different web servers, including IIS Express, Internet Information Services (IIS), External Hosts, or Custom Web Servers. You can use any of these web servers with a file-based web application project. For a file-based web site project, you can use IIS Express. This topic describes each of the web servers and how to select a web server for testing.

The following table provides summary guidance for choosing a web server in Visual web Developer.

Web server

When to use

IIS Express
</br>
IIS Express is the default web server for web application projects in Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013, and it is recommended for both web application projects and web site projects.
</br>
Local IIS
</br>
Use IIS when you want to test your web application using the server environment that is closest to what the live site will run under, and it is practical for you to install and work with IIS on your development computer. For more information, see Disadvantages of Using IIS as a Development Server with Visual Studio later in this topic.
</br>
You can use IIS with web application projects, but not with web site projects.
</br>
External Host
</br>
You can specify the URL of an external host that you will use for testing. For more information, see Advantages of using an External Host as a Development Server with Visual Studio later in this topic.
</br>
Custom Web Server
</br>
Visual Studio 2013 adds support for specifying custom Web servers in your projects; this functionality enables developers to define the environment for testing their Web applications.
</br>
IIS Express is designed to emulate IIS, but minor differences between IIS Express and the full version of IIS may result in errors that occur only after you have deployed your website to a production version of IIS. For more information, see Disadvantages of Using IIS Express later in this topic. If you use IIS Express, it is recommended that you test your application on a staging server that uses the target version of IIS before deploying it to a live site.
</br>
Specifying the Web Server for a Visual Studio Web Project
By default, Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013 use IIS Express. For more information about about how to specify one of the alternative web servers, see How to: Specify the Web Server for Web Projects in Visual Studio.
</br>
Using IIS Express with Visual Studio
IIS Express includes many of the features of IIS 7 and IIS 8 web servers without requiring you to install and manage IIS on your computer. Because IIS Express is similar to IIS 7 and IIS 8, it lets you transition web sites to IIS more smoothly than using other Web servers.
</br>
IIS Express offers the following features:
</br>
It supports and enables the same extensibility model and Web.config file settings as IIS 7 and IIS 8.
</br>
It does not require changes in your web application code.
</br>
It can be installed side-by-side with the full version of IIS and other web servers. You can choose a different web server for each project.
</br>
In corporate environments, IIS Express offers the following features:
</br>
It does not require an administrator account in order to run or debug applications.
</br>
It does not serve requests to a browser on another computer, making its approval easier in corporate environments.
</br>
It can be installed on versions of Windows that do not support IIS 7 or IIS 8.

Asp.net is Fully Based on Controls.Before Making any application ,I will learn First  about the Asp.Net Controls.If you will understand the Use of Controls then you can easily make any Application without any problem in Asp.Net.There are some Types of controls which are used in Asp.Net.
Web Forms Standard controls.
Navigation Controls
Validation Controls
Web Parts controls
Html Controls
we will understand one by one each Controls with Real Application.Now I am going to Know  What is Web Forms Controls In Asp.Net?.
Note:- Whenever you will use Web Forms Controls  in your Application then First write one Namespace Which is Given below:
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
Because All Web Forms Controls comes Under this Namespace .
Web Forms Controls:-
There are some Web Forms Controls which is given below with Real Time Example:-

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
09</br>
    {
10
 </br>
11
    }</br>
12
    protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

output:

</br>

    <b> 4.) Literal Control:-</B>
	
It is similar to Label control but there are some differences and similarities which is given below.
</br>Literal and Label control both are used to display the text(information) on the web form.
On Browser side Label control is converted to HTML 'Span' tag but Literal control is not converted in any HTML tag.
</br>We can provide formatting to the Label control but not to the Literal control.
If we want to show some HTML code and java script code the we used mainly Literal control ,not Label control.Encoding Mode is used with Literal control only.
Properties of Literal Control:-
</br>There are some important properties of Literal controls.
Mode:- IT IS A Literal control property called Mode  which can be changed as Transform,Encode and Pass Through.

16</br>
    }
17</br>
}
</br>


    <font size="5">Form Validation: Client side validation</font></br>


ASP.NET validation controls validate the user input data to ensure that useless, unauthenticated, or contradictory data don't get stored.

ASP.NET provides the following validation controls:
</br>
RequiredFieldValidator</br>
RangeValidator</br>
CompareValidator</br>
RegularExpressionValidator</br>
CustomValidator</br>
ValidationSummary</br>
BaseValidator Class</br>
The validation control classes are inherited from the BaseValidator class hence they inherit its properties and methods. Therefore, it would help to take a look at the properties and the methods of this base class, which are common for all the validation controls:
</br>
Members	Description</br>
ControlToValidate	Indicates the input control to validate.</br>
Display	Indicates how the error message is shown.</br>
EnableClientScript	Indicates whether client side validation will take.</br>
Enabled	Enables or disables the validator.</br>
ErrorMessage	Indicates error string.</br>
Text	Error text to be shown if validation fails.</br>
IsValid	Indicates whether the value of the control is valid.</br>
SetFocusOnError	It indicates whether in case of an invalid control, the focus should switch to the related input control.</br>
ValidationGroup	The logical group of multiple validators, where this control belongs.</br>
Validate()	This method revalidates the control and updates the IsValid property.</br>
RequiredFieldValidator Control</br>
The RequiredFieldValidator control ensures that the required field is not empty. It is generally tied to a text box to force input into the text box.
</br>
The syntax of the control is as given:
</br>
<asp:RequiredFieldValidator ID="rfvcandidate" 
 </br>  runat="server" ControlToValidate ="ddlcandidate"
   </br>ErrorMessage="Please choose a candidate" 
   </br>InitialValue="Please choose a candidate">
  </br> 
</asp:RequiredFieldValidator></br>
RangeValidator Control</br>
The RangeValidator control verifies that the input value falls within a predetermined range.
</br>
It has three specific properties:
</br>
Properties	Description
Type	It defines the type of the data. The available values are: Currency, Date, Double, Integer, and String.
MinimumValue	It specifies the minimum value of the range.
MaximumValue	It specifies the maximum value of the range.
The syntax of the control is as given:
</br>
<asp:RangeValidator ID="rvclass" runat="server" ControlToValidate="txtclass" 
 </br>  ErrorMessage="Enter your class (6 - 12)" MaximumValue="12" 
  </br> MinimumValue="6" Type="Integer">
   
</br></asp:RangeValidator>
CompareValidator Control
The CompareValidator control compares a value in one control with a fixed value or a value in another control.
</br>
It has the following specific properties:
</br>
Properties	Description
Type	It specifies the data type.
ControlToCompare	It specifies the value of the input control to compare with.
ValueToCompare	It specifies the constant value to compare with.
Operator	It specifies the comparison operator, the available values are: Equal, NotEqual, GreaterThan, GreaterThanEqual, LessThan, LessThanEqual, and DataTypeCheck.
The basic syntax of the control is as follows:
</br>
<asp:CompareValidator ID="CompareValidator1" runat="server" 
   ErrorMessage="CompareValidator">
 </br>  
</asp:CompareValidator>
RegularExpressionValidator
The RegularExpressionValidator allows validating the input text by matching against a pattern of a regular expression. The regular expression is set in the ValidationExpression property.
</br>
The following table summarizes the commonly used syntax constructs for regular expressions:
</br>
Character Escapes	Description</br>
\b	Matches a backspace.</br>
\t	Matches a tab.</br>
\r	Matches a carriage return.</br>
\v	Matches a vertical tab.</br>
\f	Matches a form feed.</br>
\n	Matches a new line.</br>
\	Escape character.</br>
Apart from single character match, a class of characters could be specified that can be matched, called the metacharacters.
</br>
Metacharacters	Description</br>
.	Matches any character except \n.</br>
[abcd]	Matches any character in the set.</br>
[^abcd]	Excludes any character in the set.</br>
[2-7a-mA-M]	Matches any character specified in the range.</br>
\w	Matches any alphanumeric character and underscore.</br>
\W	Matches any non-word character.</br>
\s	Matches whitespace characters like, space, tab, new line etc.</br>
\S	Matches any non-whitespace character.</br>
\d	Matches any decimal character.</br>
\D	Matches any non-decimal character.</br>
Quantifiers could be added to specify number of times a character could appear.</br>
</br>
Quantifier	Description
*	Zero or more matches.
+	One or more matches.
?	Zero or one matches.
{N}	N matches.
{N,}	N or more matches.
{N,M}	Between N and M matches.
The syntax of the control is as given:
</br>
<asp:RegularExpressionValidator ID="string" runat="server" ErrorMessage="string"
   ValidationExpression="string" ValidationGroup="string">
   </br>
</asp:RegularExpressionValidator>
CustomValidator
The CustomValidator control allows writing application specific custom validation routines for both the client side and the server side validation.
</br>
The client side validation is accomplished through the ClientValidationFunction property. The client side validation routine should be written in a scripting language, such as JavaScript or VBScript, which the browser can understand.
</br>
The server side validation routine must be called from the control's ServerValidate event handler. The server side validation routine should be written in any .Net language, like C# or VB.Net.
</br>
The basic syntax for the control is as given:

<asp:CustomValidator ID="CustomValidator1" runat="server" 
   ClientValidationFunction=.cvf_func. ErrorMessage="CustomValidator">
   </br>
</asp:CustomValidator>
ValidationSummary
The ValidationSummary control does not perform any validation but shows a summary of all errors in the page. The summary displays the values of the ErrorMessage property of all validation controls that failed validation.
</br>
The following two mutually inclusive properties list out the error message:
</br>
ShowSummary : shows the error messages in specified format.
</br>
ShowMessageBox : shows the error messages in a separate window.
</br>
The syntax for the control is as given:
</br>
<asp:ValidationSummary ID="ValidationSummary1" runat="server" 
  </br> DisplayMode = "BulletList" ShowSummary = "true" HeaderText="Errors:" />
Validation Groups</br>
Complex pages have different groups of information provided in different panels. In such situation, a need might arise for performing validation separately for separate group. This kind of situation is handled using validation groups.
</br>
To create a validation group, you should put the input controls and the validation controls into the same logical group by setting their ValidationGroup property.
</br>




</br>
   <font size="5">Ad rotator Control</font></br>

The AdRotator control randomly selects banner graphics from a list, which is specified in an external XML schedule file. This external XML schedule file is called the advertisement file.

The AdRotator control allows you to specify the advertisement file and the type of window that the link should follow in the AdvertisementFile and the Target property respectively.

The basic syntax of adding an AdRotator is as follows:

</br><asp:AdRotator  runat = "server" AdvertisementFile = "adfile.xml"  Target =  "_blank" />
Before going into the details of the AdRotator control and its properties, let us look into the construction of the advertisement file.
</br>
The Advertisement File
The advertisement file is an XML file, which contains the information about the advertisements to be displayed.
</br>
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a W3C standard for text document markup. It is a text-based markup language that enables you to store data in a structured format by using meaningful tags. The term 'extensible' implies that you can extend your ability to describe a document by defining meaningful tags for the application.
</br>
XML is not a language in itself, like HTML, but a set of rules for creating new markup languages. It is a meta-markup language. It allows developers to create custom tag sets for special uses. It structures, stores, and transports the information.
</br>
Following is an example of XML file:
</br>
<BOOK>
   <NAME> Learn XML </NAME></br>
   <AUTHOR> Samuel Peterson </AUTHOR></br>
   <PUBLISHER> NSS Publications </PUBLISHER></br>
   <PRICE> $30.00</PRICE></br>
</BOOK></br>
Like all XML files, the advertisement file needs to be a structured text file with well-defined tags delineating the data. There are the following standard XML elements that are commonly used in the advertisement file:

Element	Description</br>
Advertisements	Encloses the advertisement file.</br>
Ad	Delineates separate ad.</br>
ImageUrl	The path of image that will be displayed.</br>
NavigateUrl	The link that will be followed when the user clicks the ad.</br>
AlternateText	The text that will be displayed instead of the picture if it cannot be displayed.
Keyword	Keyword identifying a group of advertisements. This is used for filtering.</br>
Impressions	The number indicating how often an advertisement will appear.</br>
Height	Height of the image to be displayed.</br>
Width	Width of the image to be displayed.</br>
Apart from these tags, customs tags with custom attributes could also be included. The following code illustrates an advertisement file ads.xml:

<Advertisements></br>
   <Ad></br>
      <ImageUrl>rose1.jpg</ImageUrl></br>
      <NavigateUrl>http://www.1800flowers.com</NavigateUrl></br>

</br></br>
<form id="form1" runat="server">
   <div>
      <asp:AdRotator ID="AdRotator1" runat="server" AdvertisementFile  ="~/ads.xml" onadcreated="AdRotator1_AdCreated" />
   </div>
</form>
The ads.xml file and the image files should be located in the root directory of the web site.
</br>
Try to execute the above application and observe that each time the page is reloaded, the ad is changed.

Internet Explorer WebControls
This article provides a general overview of Windows Internet Explorer WebControls, which are a powerful collection of ASP.NET server controls. The WebControls implement a single-source authoring solution for four popular UI elements: MultiPage, TabStrip, Toolbar, and TreeView.
</br>
The WebControls deliver content that renders in all commonly used browsers, while taking advantage of powerful features supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or later versions. The WebControls provide an authoring solution with widespread reach, by delivering HTML 3.2 compatible content to downlevel browsers (Internet Explorer 5.01 or earlier or a browser other than Internet Explorer). ASP.NET Web forms detect the client browser capabilities and include Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behaviors in the Web pages downloaded to uplevel browsers (Internet Explorer 5.5 or later). The objects exposed by the DHTML behaviors and the ASP.NET controls are presented in the Internet Explorer WebControls Reference.

</br>
Prerequisites
In order to gain the most benefit from this article, the reader should have some familiarity with ASP.NET controls. Developers who have prior experience in using or developing Active Server Pages (ASP) custom components will also find the main concepts behind using the WebControls familiar.
</br>
Authoring with WebControls
To host and develop Web pages with the WebControls, either the .NET Framework SDK or Visual Studio .NET products must to be installed on the hosting computer. Both of these products install ASP.NET as a part of the setup process. After ASP.NET is running on your computer, the WebControls can be installed. To install the controls on your computer, see the Internet Explorer WebControls Download page.

There are a few common ground rules and recommendations that apply to authoring Web Forms pages with all of the WebControls, and these are discussed in Authoring Web Forms with the WebControls.
</br>
Introduction
In order to fully appreciate what WebControls can do to improve and streamline the Web development process, it's worth considering some of the major problems that currently challenge Web developers.
</br>
The Web Developer's Problem
Several different browsers are now being used to surf the Internet, and the number of browser types and versions is increasing continuously. This has become a major challenge for Web developers because each browser has a distinct set of features and capabilities. The complex maze of browser incompatibilities has forced many developers with limited resources to write Web pages in HTML 3.2 because support for this standard is fairly widespread. Although HTML 3.2 provides a basic common denominator, premium Web sites have to deliver more sophisticated user experiences than HTML 3.2 alone can support.
</br>
In order to provide premium Web content, many Web development teams have developed multiple solutions for their Web sites. This approach has delivered an improved user experience for the more capable browsers, but all too often, at great expense. Many development teams, and most individuals, simply do not have the resources to develop multiple solutions for their Web sites.
</br>
This scenario has resulted in the need for more intelligent authoring technologies that streamline and simply the process of developing content for a wide range of browsers.
</br>
Solutions for the Web Developer
ASP.NET is designed to solve, or at least greatly simplify, many of the challenges facing Web developers. One of the most powerful features of the ASP.NET platform is that it supports custom server controls. ASP.NET controls can be used to define custom XML elements.The WebControls implement several custom elements for authoring UI.
</br>
The WebControls are custom ASP.NET server controls. These controls detect the client browser type and version. The WebControls deliver a wide-reaching solution to downlevel browsers, and enhanced client content is sent to uplevel browsers.
</br>
Web pages using DHTML behaviors are delivered to uplevel browsers; this type of content updates dynamically on the client, providing a superior user experience. In downlevel browsers, user interactions post updates back to the ASP.NET controls on the Web server. The server-side WebControls refresh the rendering and keep track of the state of the Web page. The Web pages downloaded by the uplevel browsers are richer because they incorporate numerous enhancements, including extensive customization, keyboard input, page rendering quality, and other enhancements to the page functionality. In the uplevel client pages, the number of server roundtrips is reduced significantly because the client browser processes most of the user-interaction and rendering updates locally.
</br>
By providing a single-source solution, the WebControls can reduce development costs and simplify many authoring tasks significantly. Also, authoring with the WebControls enables authors to take advantage of the advanced capabilities in Internet Explorer 5.5 or later versions with no additional effort or cost.
</br>
ASP.NET Controls
To provide some context for the WebControls, the other types of ASP.NET controls are reviewed here.
</br>
Intrinsic
Intrinsic controls create HTML-style elements on the client. These are intelligent controls that detect the browser type and automatically maintain state.
</br>
List
List controls automatically produce lists of all kinds on the client. In conjunction with server-side data binding, they can also populate lists with data from databases and XML files and can be written with a few lines of code.

Rich
Rich Controls output client-side HTML and, in some cases, client-side script as well. These controls are used to create more complex interface elements on the client. Examples of ASP.NET controls include the Calendar and the AdRotator. Rich controls detect the browser type and version and create the corresponding HTML to render correctly in the client.

Validation
Validation controls are nonvisible controls; they do not render as visible content in the client. These controls simplify client-side or server-side validation when forms are presented to the user for data entry.
</br>
Custom
The WebControls are custom ASP.NET controls and, in many ways, function similarly to other rich ASP.NET controls. The WebControls go further than most rich controls in taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of Internet Explorer 5.5 or later versions. Custom controls have their own namespace, which for the WebControls is Microsoft.Web.UI.WebControls.

Tour of the WebControls
This section provides a brief tour of the WebControls and illustrates the type of interface that can be created by each one. Each section focuses on one of the WebControls and links to the appropriate overviews and reference documentation

   <font size="5">State management</font></br>

</br>
Introduction 
This article does an overview of state management techniques in ASP.NET. I will be discussing about the various types of state management techniques both client side and server side. 
</br>
Background 
State management means to preserve state of a control, web page, object/data, and user in the application explicitly because all ASP.NET web applications are stateless, i.e., by default, for each page posted to the server, the state of controls is lost. Nowadays all web apps demand a high level of state management from control to application level.
</br>
Using the code 
Types of state management  
There are two types of state management techniques: client side and server side.
</br>
Client side</br>
Hidden Field</br>
View State</br>
Cookies</br>
Control State</br>
Query Strings</br>
Server side</br>
Session</br>
Application</br>
Levels of state management </br>
Control level: In ASP.NET, by default controls provide state management automatically.
Variable or object level: In ASP.NET, member variables at page level are stateless and thus we need to maintain state explicitly.
</br>Single or multiple page level: State management at single as well as multiple page level i.e., managing state between page requests.
</br>User level: State should be preserved as long as a user is running the application.
Application level: State available for complete application irrespective of the user, i.e., should be available to all users.
Application to application level: State management between or among two or more applications.
Client side methods
</br><b>1. Hidden field</b></br>
Hidden field is a control provided by ASP.NET which is used to store small amounts of data on the client. It store one value for the variable and it is a preferable way when a variable's value is changed frequently. Hidden field control is not rendered to the client (browser) and it is invisible on the browser. A hidden field travels with every request like a standard control’s value.
</br>
Let us see with a simple example how to use a hidden field. These examples increase a value by 1 on every "No Action Button" click. The source of the hidden field control is. 
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
<asp:HiddenField ID="HiddenField1" runat="server"  />  
In the code-behind page:

Hide </br>  Copy Code
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{</br>
   if (HiddenField1.Value != null)
   {</br>
    </br>int val= Convert.ToInt32(HiddenField1.Value) + 1;
    </br>HiddenField1.Value = val.ToString();
    </br>Label1.Text = val.ToString();
   }</br>
}</br>
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  //this is No Action Button Click
}
</br><b>2. View state</b></br>
View state is another client side state management mechanism provided by ASP.NET to store user's data, i.e., sometimes the user needs to preserve data temporarily after a post back, then the view state is the preferred way for doing it. It stores data in the generated HTML using hidden field not on the server. 
</br>
View State provides page level state management i.e., as long as the user is on the current page, state is available and the user redirects to the next page and the current page state is lost. View State can store any type of data because it is object type but it is preferable not to store a complex type of data due to the need for serialization and deserilization on each post back. View state is enabled by default for all server side controls of ASP.NET with a property EnableviewState set to true.
</br>
Let us see how ViewState is used with the help of the following example. In the example we try to save the number of postbacks on button click.
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{</br>
    if (IsPostBack)
    {</br>
        if (ViewState["count"] != null)
        {</br>
     </br>       int ViewstateVal = Convert.ToInt32(ViewState["count"]) + 1;
          </br>  Label1.Text = ViewstateVal.ToString();
            ViewState["count"]=ViewstateVal.ToString();
        }</br>
        else
        {
            ViewState["count"] = "1";
        }</br>
    }</br>
}</br>
protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
       Label1.Text=ViewState["count"].ToString();
}
</br><b>3. Cookies</b></br>
Cookie is a small text file which is created by the client's browser and also stored on the client hard disk by the browser. It does not use server memory. Generally a cookie is used to identify users.

A cookie is a small file that stores user information. Whenever a user makes a request for a page the first time, the server creates a cookie and sends it to the client along with the requested page and the client browser receives that cookie and stores it on the client machine either permanently or temporarily (persistent or non persistence). The next time the user makes a request for the same site, either the same or another page, the browser checks the existence of the cookie for that site in the folder. If the cookie exists it sends a request with the same cookie, else that request is treated as a new request. 

</br><b>Types of Cookies</b>
</br><b>1. Persistence Cookie:</b> </br>Cookies which you can set an expiry date time are called persistence cookies. Persistence cookies are permanently stored till the time you set.

Let us see how to create persistence cookies. There are two ways, the first one is:   
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
Response.Cookies["nameWithPCookies"].Value = "This is A Persistance Cookie";
Response.Cookies["nameWithPCookies"].Expires = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(10); 
And the second one is:  

</br>Hide   Copy Code
HttpCookie aCookieValPer = new HttpCookie("Persistance");
</br>aCookieValPer.Value = "This is A Persistance Cookie";
</br>aCookieValPer.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(10);
Response.Cookies.Add(aCookieValPer);
</br><b>2. Non-Persistence Cookie:</b> </br>Non persistence cookies are not permanently stored on the user client hard disk folder. It maintains user information as long as the user accesses the same browser. When user closes the browser the cookie will be discarded. Non Persistence cookies are useful for public computers.

Let us see how to create a non persistence cookies. There are two ways, the first one is:
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
Response.Cookies["nameWithNPCookies"].Value = "This is A Non Persistance Cookie";
And the second way is:
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
HttpCookie aCookieValNonPer = new HttpCookie("NonPersistance");
aCookieValNonPer.Value = "This is A Non Persistance Cookie;
Response.Cookies.Add(aCookieValNonPer);how to create cookie : 
How to read a cookie:
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
if (Request.Cookies["NonPersistance"] != null)
Label2.Text = Request.Cookies["NonPersistance"].Value;
Let's understand persistence and non persistence cookies more clearly with a diagram:

</br>

Limitation of cookies: The number of cookies allowed is limited and varies according to the browser. Most browsers allow 20 cookies per server in a client's hard disk folder and the size of a cookie is not more than 4096 bytes or 4 KB of data that also includes name and value data. 

</br><b>4. Control State</b></br>
Control State is another client side state management technique. Whenever we develop a custom control and want to preserve some information, we can use view state but suppose view state is disabled explicitly by the user, the control will not work as expected. For expected results for the control we have to use Control State property. Control state is separate from view state.
</br>
How to use control state property: Control state implementation is simple. First override the OnInit() method of the control and add a call for the Page.RegisterRequiresControlState() method with the instance of the control to register. Then override LoadControlState and SaveControlState in order to save the required state information.

</br>Server side
</br><b>1. Session</b>   
Session management is a very strong technique to maintain state. Generally session is used to store user's information and/or uniquely identify a user (or say browser). The server maintains the state of user information by using a session ID. When users makes a request without a session ID, ASP.NET creates a session ID and sends it with every request and response to the same user.
</br>
How to get and set value in Session:
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
Session["Count"] = Convert.ToInt32(Session["Count"]) + 1;//Set Value to The Session
</br>Label2.Text = Session["Count"].ToString(); //Get Value from the Sesion 
</br>Let us see an example where we save the count of button clicks in a session, and save the “number of redirects to the same page” button click in a query string. Here I have set the expiry to 10 minutes. After starting the application, the application variable exists till the end of the application. A session variable will expire after 10 minutes (if it is idle). A query string contains the value in URL so it won’t depend on the user idle time and could be used by the server anytime it is passed with a request.  


</br>
Session Events in ASP.NET  
To manage a session, ASP.NET provides two events: session_start and session_end that is written in a special file called Global.asax in the root directory of the project. 
</br>
Session_Start: The Session_start event is raised every time a new user makes a request without a session ID, i.e., new browser accesses the application, then a session_start event raised. Let's see the Global.asax file.  

</br>Hide   Copy Code
void Session_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{</br>
</br>   Session["Count"] = 0;  // Code that runs when a new session is started
}</br>
Session_End: The Session_End event is raised when session ends either because of a time out expiry or explicitly by using Session.Abandon(). The Session_End event is raised only in the case of In proc mode not in the state server and SQL Server modes. 
</br>
There are four session storage mechanisms provided by ASP.NET:
</br>
In Proc mode </br>
State Server mode </br> 
SQL Server mode </br>
Custom mode  </br>
In Process mode: In proc mode is the default mode provided by ASP.NET. In this mode, session values are stored in the web server's memory (in IIS). If there are more than one IIS servers then session values are stored in each server separately on which request has been made. Since the session values are stored in server, whenever server is restarted the session values will be lost. 
</br>
Hide   Copy Code
<configuration>
 </br><sessionstate mode="InProc" cookieless="false" timeout="10" 
</br>
    stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:80808" 
</br>
    sqlConnectionString="Data Source=.\SqlDataSource;User ID=userid;Password=password"/>
</configuration> 
In State Server mode: This mode could store session in the web server but out of the application pool. But usually if this mode is used there will be a separate server for storing sessions, i.e., stateServer. The benefit is that when IIS restarts the session is available. It stores session in a separate Windows service. For State server session mode, we have to configure it explicitly in the web config file and start the aspnet_state service.

Hide   Copy Code</br>
<configuration><sessionstate mode="stateserver" cookieless="false" </br>

   timeout="10"  stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:42424"  
</br>
   sqlConnectionString="Data Source=.\SqlDataSource;User ID=userid;Password=password"/> </configuration> 
In SQL Server mode: Session is stored in a SQL Server database. This kind of session mode is also separate from IIS, i.e., session is available even after restarting the IIS server. This mode is highly secure and reliable but also has a disadvantage that there is overhead from serialization and deserialization of session data. This mode should be used when reliability is more important than performance. 

Hide   Copy Code</br>
<configuration>
   </br> <sessionstate mode="sqlserver" cookieless="false" timeout="10" 
</br>
       stateConnectionString="tcpip=127.0.0.1:4  2424" 
</br>
     </br>  sqlConnectionString="Data Source=.\SqlDataSource;User ID=userid;Password=password"/>
</configuration></br>
Custom Session mode: Generally we should prefer in proc state server mode or SQL Server mode but if you need to store session data using other than these techniques then ASP.NET provides a custom session mode. This way we have to maintain everything customized even generating session ID, data store, and also security.
