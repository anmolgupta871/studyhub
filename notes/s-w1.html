Since, software is a logical system (whereas, hardware is a physical system), its characteristics are different from hardware:</br>1.	Software is developed or engineered; it is not manufactured in the classical sense.</br>2.	Software doesn‟t “wear out”.</br>3.	Most of the software continues to be custom built or customizable.</br></br><font size="5">Q.3	Compare software development and hardware manufacture?</br>Ans:</font>	Similarities between software development & hardware manufacture:</br>High quality is achieved through good designBoth activities depend on people and their requirements.</br>Dissimilarities between software development & hardware manufacture:The manufacturing phase of hardware can have quality problems which couldn‟t be rectified as easily as in software development phase.Though both activities depend on people, but the relationship between the people applied and work accomplished is entirely different. As for hardware manufacturing market survey and competitors policies are to be considered on priority, whereas software development concentrates more on the user requirements.Both activities target for a product as a result, but the approaches followed are entirely different. (As there are SDLC set of phases for software development, whereas the product manufacturing involves different phases like consumer tendency, market analysis etc.)Cost of manufacturing a hardware product could be estimated exactly & easily, whereas it‟s comparatively difficult to estimate exactly in case of software development.Software doesn‟t “Wear out”. </br> Failure curve for hardware</br>This curve shows that hardware show high rate of failure in it‟s early stage due to design or manufacturing defects, when there defects are corrected, the failure rate deeps i.e. very low & steady for a period of time. But as the time passes, due to environmental effects like temperature, dust, moisture, the hardware begins to wear out. In a broader way, as comparing software with hardware, we can say that the software doesn‟t wear out due to environmental conditions (as in case of hardware). Theoretically the failure rate v/s time curve for software is an ideal curve as shown in figure 1.2Here in the initial cycle of a software, undiscovered defects cause high failure rates, but if they are corrected (i.e. made errorfree), the curve becomes flat & ideal with very less failure rate. This shows that software doesn‟t wear out, but the fact is that, it deteriorates by the attack of malicious software (virus, Trojan horse etc.) and also by time the user‟s demands changes and updations are required which leads to further changes & modifications causing to increase in failure rates as shown in figure 1.3.</br>Figure 1.3 Actual curve for Software </br>7	Software Engineering</br>The software industry is moving towards component based assembly. Most of the software continues to be customer built. As in case of hardware, we have well defined set of IC or chips (Integrated) and screws and other components and that could be used to design different hardware (reusability of hardware components). In case of software, library routines & subroutines are to be developed for reusability. A software component should be designed & implemented so that is can be reused in many other different programs.</br></br><font size="5">Q.4	What are Software Myths?</br>Ans:</font> Most, knowledgeable professionals have recognized myths or beliefs (untrue beliefs or explanations) which are misguiding the attitudes (of the users) causing serious problems for managers & technical persons. Different types of Myths relevant to the software are as classified in figure 1.4.</br>management Myths:Myth 1:We have all the standards & procedures available for building software i.e the software developer have everything what is reqd.</br>Reality:</br>-	Software practitioners are not aware about the existence of all those standards.</br>-	Those practices might be outdated or not according to the current /modern software engineering practices.</br>-	Also all the pre-existing procedures, are not complete.</br>Myth 2:</br>The Addition of latest hardware systems would improve the software development.</br>Reality:</br>-	The role of latest hardware is not too high for the quality software development; instead (CASE) Computer aided software engineering tools are more important than hardware for a good & quality productivity.</br>-	Also the available hardware resources are not used effectively.</br>Management thinks that, addition of more people and programmers in software development could help in meeting the deadlines of the project (If it is lagging behind)</br>-	Software development is not, a mechanistic process like manufacturing; here addition of people in late phases may reduce the amount of time to be used for the productive development, as the newcomers would take time of existing developers for the explanations & understanding for the project. But, addition of people done in a planned & well-coordinated manner could be helpful in the project completion.</br>(ii)Customer Myths:</br>Customer could be the direct users of the software, a technical group, marketing /sales department, or some other company. The customer possesses the myths which lead to the false expectations (by the customer) & hence create dissatisfaction with the developer.</br>Myth 1:</br>A general statement of objectives is sufficient to begin writing programs (software development) and the details of the objectives could be done later.</br>Reality:</br>A formal & detailed description of the information domain function, behaviors performance, interfaces, design constraints and validation criteria is essential. A thorough communication between customer & developer is must.</br>Myth 2:</br>Project requirement continually change, but, change, can be easily accommodated due to the flexible nature of the software.</br>Reality:</br>Changes are made till the last phases of the software development but the cost of making those changes increase with the later stages of development. A detailed analysis of user requirements should be done to minimize the change requirement. Fig 1.5 shows the cost of change with respect to the phases of development.</br>9	Software Engineering</br>F Cost of change</br>(iii)Practitioner’s Myths:</br>Myths 1:</br></br>They believe that their job is completed with the program writing & get it worked.</br>Reality:</br>It‟s a reality that 60-80% of all the efforts go in the maintenance phase (as after the release) of the software. The efforts are required, when the product is delivered first time to the customer.</br>Myths 2:</br>There is no (other) way of accessing the quality of the program, after it is being made to run.Reality</br>:</br>The formal technical review of the project is an effective software quality assurance mechanism. These reviews are the quality filters and more approachable than the testing.</br>Myth 3:</br>The working program is the only deliverable work product for a successful project.</br>Reality:</br>The working program is not only sufficient, instead proper documents manuals and handouts are also reqd. to be supplied for the guidance & software support.</br>Myth4:</br>Software Engineering will make us create voluminous & unnecessary document & invariably slow us down.</br>Reality: Software Engineering is not about creating documents, instead it is there for creating quality and better quality leads to the reduced rework & this reads to a faster delivery of the product.</br></br><font size="5">Q.5	What are various Software Applications?Ans: </font>Software may be applied in any situation for which a specified set of procedural steps (i.e. an algorithm) has been defined.

Five phases of this model are shown in fig 2.8. RAD Model</br>Phases of RAD Model</br>Phase 1 Business Modeling (BM):Information flow is defined & described with the description of source & destination of the informatin</br>Phase 2 Data modeli (DM): Here the information flow is refined. For this, the information flow is partitioned into different data objects (having their own attributes). The relationship & connectivity is established between these data objects.</br>Phase 3 Process Modeling (PM): Data objects are combined to provide the information flow of each business function. Documents & reports are prepared related to the date manipulation of the date objects.</br>Phase 4 Application Generation (AG): Product is build will the help of new components & the already exiting components. The now built new components also serve as the receivable components for future purpose.</br>Phase 5 Testing & Turnover:</br>Unit testing is done for new added components as older components are already tested.

Incremental</br>2.	Spiral</br>3.	WINWIN Spiral</br>4.	Concurrent development model</br>Software Engineering</br>-	Evolutionary model expands the development stages in an incremental manner i.e. all the phases are developed one-by-one to incorporate all the well understood requirements.</br>-	Evolutionary models are iterative in nature</br>-	They are meant to develop increasingly more complete versions of the software</br>-	It basically combines waterfall & prototype model</br>An evolutionary process model can be described .</br> Phases of Evolutionary Process Model</br></br><font size="5">Q.8	Explain Incremental Model</br>Ans:	</font>Incremental model is:-Introduced by “Mills”</br>-Combination of linear sequential & prototype model</br>-Each increment or interaction adds some functional capability to the software until the full software is implemented. The incremental model is shown in fig. 2.9. Incremental Model</br>-	With the release of each increment, experience is gained by developer as well as user.</br>-	User can delay his decisions until he don‟t experiences the software.</br>-	In the initial stages, user specifies his important & well known requirement. The release of first increment is also known as core product. This product is practically used & tested by the user for further clarification of their requirements. This addition of new requirements helps in building of the next increment with more capabilities. This process continues in the iteration mode until the nth iteration completes .At this stage the complete software is developed.</br>Advantage of Incremental Model</br>-	Less Human resources are required at the beginning and as the number of increment increases, more members can be added to the project</br>-	Resource management could be done efficiently as if a resource which is felt to be included in an increment, if not available could be added in later increments.</br>-	Regular and progressive evaluation of the new increments one after another (by the customer)</br>-	User‟s customer gains experience & knowledge about the product with the release of increments.</br>-	Lesser Project failure risk as a product accompanied with constant exposure to the user satisfaction & evaluation is revised with every increment.</br>Disadvantages of Incremental model</br>-	Size of the increment should be optimum, otherwise small size could be a time consuming development and large one could be too complex.</br>-	Categorization of best & most important requirements by the customers is difficult.</br></br><font size="5">Ques.9: Explain Spiral Model</br>Ans:</font> Spiral Model was introduced by “ Boehm”.

Planning: - It is required to define resources, timelines and other projects related information.</br>Region3. Risk Analysis:- It is required to asses both technical & management risks.</br>Region4. Engineering: - It is required to build one or more presentations of the application and the best one is selected.</br>Region5. Construction & delivery: - It is required to construct, test, install and provide user support like user manuals and training.</br>Region6. Customer Evaluation: It is required to obtain customer feedback and evaluation of the software representation.</br>Advantages of the Spiral Model</br>-	Software remains active throughout its life</br>-	Software in maintainable</br>-	Realistic Approach</br>-	Reduced Risk</br>Disadvantage of Spiral Model</br>-	It is difficult to satisfy the customer during evolution</br>-	Risk analyst is required</br>-	Slow development</br>-	High monetary cost</br>-	Requires more efforts for implementation</br></br><font size="5">Q.10	What is Concurrent developmental model?</br>Ans:</font>	This is also known as Concurrent Engineering model.</br>-	Here all activities of development are done simultaneously in parallel.</br>-	For each activity, a state transition diagram is made, where all events of an activity are shown as states & there should be transitions between them.</br>-	Provides an accurate idea about the states of the project.</br></br><font size="5">Q.11:  What is DOD model?</br>Ans:</font> DOD Model is Department of Defense Model.

Here, an outlined schedule is developed. And then, a detailed schedule is redefined for each entry in the macroscopic schedule.</br>Basic tasks and principles for software project scheduling are:</br>-	Division of tasks or Compartmentalization</br>-	Identification of Interdependency</br>-	Time allocation</br>-	Effort allocation & validation</br>-	Defined responsibilities,</br>-	Defined outcomes & milestones</br></br><font size="5">Q.7	What are the methods of Project Scheduling?</br>Ans:</font>	Two project scheduling methods:</br>-	Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)</br>-	Critical Path Method (CPM)</br>Both methods are driven by information developed in earlier project planning activities and include:</br>-	Estimates of effort</br>-	A decomposition of product function</br>-	The selection of the appropriate process model</br>-	The selection of project type and task set</br></br><font size="5">Software Metrics and Measures</br></br>Q.1	What do you mean by Software Metrics and Measures?</br>Ans:</font> Metrics provide the scale for quantifying qualities. For example, in software project the length is seen in terms of size metric of Software, then the unit of measurement of size is LOC (Line of Code).Metrics provide a quantification of some property, whereas measurements provide the, actual value for the metrics. Software metric is a measure of some property of a piece of software or its specification.Types of Metrics:Indirect Metric: If metric can‟t be measured directly eg: Reliability of the software, that is estimated from other possible measurements. Direct Metric: Metric that can be measured directly eg: SizeOne way of Cat Categories of MetricsAnother way of Categorization of Software Metric-	Size-oriented Metrics-	Function-Oriented Metrics-	Human-Oriented Metrics-	Productivity Metrics-	Quality Metrics-	Technical Metrics</br></br><font size="5">Q.2	What are process Metrics ?</br>Ans: </font>Process metrics are used to check the progress of project development.

Data from past projects are used to collect the various metrics (Time and Cost) then these metric and their estimates act as the base of the new software. As the project proceeds, the project manager will check its progress regularly time to time and compare the effort, time cost, with the estimated ones.</br></br><font size="5">Q.4	What do you mean by Measuring Software and Measurement?</br>Ans: </font>In the field of Engineering, it is easy to measure the power consumption, but in software development measure it is difficult to find that what to measure & how to evaluate measurements. As we know that Software measurement is required for the following reasons:</br>-	To indicate the quality of the product</br>-	To assess the productivity of the people who produce the product.</br>-	To assess the advantage like productivity & quality derived from new software engineering methods & tools.</br>-	To form a baseline for estimation</br>-	To justify requests for new tools or additional trai</br>Categorization of MeasurementDirect Measures: Direct measures are the one which are measured directly from the software project itself. Eg: lines of code (LOC), memory size, execution speed.Indirect Measures: These measures are not measured directly Eg: complexity reliability , maintainability.</br></br><font size="5">Q.5	What are the various empirical estimation models.</br>Ans:</font> An empirical estimation model for a software is used to predict effort as a function of Lines of Code (LOC) or Function Point (FP). “Basili” has described four types of resource Models:</br>1-	Static single –variable models (ex-COCOMO)</br>2-	Static Multivariable models</br>3-	Dynamic Multivariable models</br>4-	Theoretical Models</br>1-	Static Single Variable Model:- The equation for this resource model is:</br>Resource = C1 x (Estimated Characteristic) C2Where, resource= effort/project duration/staff size/pages of documentationC1  and C2 = Constants derived from data collected from past projects& Estimated characteristic = LOC/Efforts/Any Characteristics2- Static multivariable model: These models use the historical data to derive empirical relationship. These model use the equation:Resource = C11e1+ C21e2 +-----------Where, ei = ith software characteristicsC1, C2= Constts.Eg. Of such model is Intermediate COCOMO</br>3- Dynamic Multivariable Model : Resource is defined as a function of time allocating some % of effort to each step in software engineering process.</br>4- Theoretical Model: Putnam is theoretical dynamic multivariable model. “ Result is a resource expenditure curve”.</br></div></body></html>
