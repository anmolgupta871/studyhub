</br>
Q.1	What is Risk Projection?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Risk Projection also called risk estimation, attempts to rate each risk on the basis of Probability and Consequences.

The risk drivers affecting each risk component are:
</br>
•	classified according to their impact category
</br>
•	potential consequences of each undetected software fault or unachieved project outcome are described
</br></br>
<font size="5">
Q.2	What is Risk Management?</br>

Ans: </font>Risk Management can be defined as: “A logical process for identifying and analyzing leading to appropriate methods for handling and monitoring exposures to loss”.
</br>
Risk management deals with:</br>
-	Systematic identification of an exposure to the risk of loss, &
</br>
-	Making decisions on the best methods for handling these exposures to minimize losses
</br></br><font size="5">
Q.3	What is Risk Analysis with Risk Identification and Projection?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Risk Analysis includes:
</br>
•	Risk identification</br>
•	Risk projection</br>
–   impact of risks/likelihood of risk actually happening</br>

•	Risk assessment</br>
–   what will change if risk becomes problem</br>
•	Risk mana</br>
</br>

Q.4	Explain RMMM? Give a brief overview of RMMM plan.</br>

Ans:</font>	RMMM is Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management An effective strategy must consider three issues:
</br>-	risk mitigation/reduction/avoidance,</br>

-	risk monitoring, </br>
-	risk management and contingency(emergency) planning
</br>
•	Risk Mitigation</br>
–   proactive planning for risk avoidance</br>
•	Risk Monitoring</br>
–   assessing whether predicted risks occur or not</br>
–   ensuring risk aversion steps are being properly applied</br>
–   collect information for future risk analysis</br>
–   determining which risks caused which problems</br>

•	Risk Management</br>
–   contingency planning</br>

– actions to be taken in the event that mitigation steps have failed and the risk has become a live problem

Q.6  Explain Project Scheduling and Tracking?</br>
Ans:
</font>
Software project scheduling is an activity that distributes estimated effort across the planed project duration by allocating the effort to specific software engineering tasks.
</br>
First, a macroscopic schedule is developed. Then, a detailed schedule is redefined for each entry in the macroscopic schedule. A Project schedule evolves over time.
</br>
Few guiding principles for software project scheduling are:</br>

-	Compartmentalization</br>

-	Interdependency</br>
-	Time allocation</br>
-	Effort allocation</br>
-	Effort validation</br>

-	Defined responsibilities</br>
-	Defined outcomes</br>
-	Defined milestones
</br>
Two well known project scheduling methods are:</br>
-	Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)</br>
-	Critical Path Method (CPM)
</br>
Similarity between the two methods :</br>

Both methods are driven by information developed in earlier project planning activities:</br>

-	Estimates of effort</br>
-	A decomposition of product function
</br>
-	The selection of the appropriate process model</br>
-	The selection of project type and task set</br>

Both methods allow a planner to do:</br>

-	determine the critical path</br>
-	time estimation</br>
-	calculate boundary times for each task
</br>
Boundary times:</br>
-	the earliest time and latest time to begin a task</br>
-	the earliest time and latest time to complete a task</br>
-	the total float.</br>
</br><font size="5">
Q.7	Explain Project Tracking?
</br>
Ans:	</font>The project schedule provides a road map for a software project manager. It defines the tasks and milestones.
</br>
Several ways to track a project schedule:
</br>
-	Conducting periodic project status meeting</br>

-	Evaluating the review results in the software process</br>
-	Determine if formal project milestones have been accomplished</br>
-	Compare actual start date to planned start date for each task</br>

-	Informal meeting with practitioners</br><

Quality Management
</br>
<font size="5">
Q.1	Explain process and product quality
</br>
Ans:</font>	Understanding, Modelling and Improving the Software Process is process improvement.
</br>
-	Process quality and product quality are closely related
</br>
-	A good process is usually required to produce a good product
</br>
-	For manufactured goods, process is the principal quality determinant
</br>
-	For design-based activity, other factors are also involved especially the capabilities of the designers

</br>
Principal product quality factors
</br>
-	For large projects with average capabilities, the development process determines product quality
</br>
-	For small projects, the capabilities of the developers is the main determinant
</br>
-	The development technology is particularly significant for small projects
</br>
-	In all cases, if an unrealistic schedule is imposed then product quality will suffer

Q.2	What do you mean by Quality assurance and its standards?
</br>
Ans:</font>	Quality assurance is establishing organisational procedures and standards for quality.
</br>
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Activities:
</br>
•	Prepares an SQA plan for a project
</br>
•	Participates in the development of the project's software process description
</br>
•	Reviews software engineering activities to verify compliance with the defined software process
</br>
•	Audits designated software work products to verify compliance with those defined as part of the software process
</br>
•	Ensures that deviations in software work and work products are documented and handled according to a documented procedure
</br>
•	Records any noncompliance and reports to senior management</br>
•	Coordinates the control and management of change
</br>
•	Helps to collect and analyze software metrics
</br>

Standards:</br>
-	Standards are the key to effective quality management
</br>
-	They may be international, national, organizational or project standards

</br>
-	Product standards define characteristics that all components should exhibit e.g. a common programming style
</br>
-	Process standards define how the software process should be enacted
</br>
Importance of standards:</br>
-	Encapsulation of best practice- avoids repetition of past mistakes
</br>
-	Framework for quality assurance process - it involves checking standard compliance
</br>
-	Provide continuity - new staff can understand the organisation by understand the standards applied

</br>
Certification Standards:
</br>1.	ISO 9000
</br>
2.	ISO 9001
</br></br><font size="5">
Q.3	What is Quality planning?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Quality planning is selecting applicable procedures and standards for a particular project and modify these as required.
</br>
-	A quality plan sets out the desired product qualities and how these are assessed and define the most significant quality attributes
</br>
-	It should define the quality assessment process
</br>
-	It should set out which organisational standards should be applied and, if necessary, define new standards
</br>
Quality plan structure:</br>
-	Product introduction</br>
-	Product plans</br>

-	Process descriptions</br>
-	Quality goals</br>
-	Risks and risk management</br>
-	Quality plans should be short, succinct documents
</br></br><font size="5">
Q.4	What is Quality control?
</br>
Ans:	</font>Quality control is ensuring that procedures and standards are followed by the software development team.
</br>
Quality Control :
</br>
•	Involves a series of inspections, reviews, and tests used throughout the software process
</br>
•	Ensures that each work product meets the requirements placed on it
</br>
•	Includes a feedback loop to the process that created the work product
</br>
•	Combines measurement and feedback in order to adjust the process when product specifications are not met
</br>
•	Requires all work products to have defined, measurable specifications to which practitioners may compare to the output of each process
