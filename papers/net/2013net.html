Q2:-(a) What is .NET framework?</br>
        Ans:The .NET framework is a software development framework
            from Microsoft. It provides a controlled programming
            environment where software can be developed, installed
            and executed on Windows-based operating systems
</br>

(b) State the featuers of C#.</br>
        Ans.Definition</br>
            Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal
            state changes. The object will appear to change its
            class. </br>

            Participants</br>
            The classes and objects participating in this pattern are: </br>
            Context  (Account) </br>
                          ?defines the interface of interest to clients
                          ?maintains an instance of a ConcreteState
                           subclass that defines the current state.
            State  (State) </br>
                          ?defines an interface for encapsulating the
                           behavior associated with a particular state
                           of the Context.</br>
            Concrete State  (RedState, SilverState, GoldState) 
                          ?each subclass implements a behavior 
                          associated with a state of Context</br>
(c) Where should we use XML?</br>
        Ans.Here are a few reasons for using XMLL:-</br>
            •XML can be used to describe and identify information 
             accurately and unambiguously, in a way that computers can be
             programmed to ‘understand’ your information (well, at least 
             manipulate as if they could understand it).</br>
            •XML allows sets of documents which are all the same type to
             be created and handled consistently and without structural 
             errors, because it provides a standardised way of describing,
             controlling, or allowing/disallowing particular types of
             document structure. [Note that this has absolutely nothing
             whatever to do with formatting, appearance, or the actual text
             or data content of your documents, only the structure of them.
             If you want styling or formatting, see How do I control the
             formatting of XML?.]</br>
            •XML provides a robust and durable format for information 
             storage and transmission. Robust because it is based on a
             proven standard, and can thus be tested and verified; durable 
             (persistent) because it uses plain-text file formats which will
             outlast proprietary binary ones.</br>
            •XML provides a common syntax for messaging systems for the 
             exchange of information between applications. Previously, each
             messaging system had its own format and all were different,
             which made inter-system messaging unnecessarily messy, complex,
             and expensive. If everyone uses the same syntax it makes writing 
             these systems much faster and more reliable.</br>
            •XML is free. Not just free of charge (free as in beer) but free 
             of legal encumbrances (free as in speech). It doesn't belong to
             anyone, so it can't be hijacked or pirated. And you don't have to
             pay a fee to use it (you can of course choose to use commercial
             software to deal with it, for lots of good reasons, but you don't
             pay for XML itself).</br>
            •XML information can be manipulated programmatically (under machine
             control), so XML documents can be pieced together from disparate 
             sources, or taken apart and re-used in different ways. They can be
             converted into any other format with no loss of information.</br>
            •XML lets you separate form (appearance) from content. Your XML file 
             contains your document information (text, data) and identifies its 
             structure: your formatting and other processing needs are identified
             separately in a stylesheet or processing system. The two are combined
             at output time to apply the required formatting to the text or data
             identified by its structure.</br>
            •Any of the Design Goals listed in the XML Specification

        (d) What is ASP?</br>
        Ans.An Active Server Page (ASP) is an HTML page that includes one or more
            scripts (small embedded programs) that are processed on a Microsoft
            Web server before the page is sent to the user. An ASP is somewhat
            similar to a server-side include or a common gateway interface (CGI)
            application in that all involve programs that run on the server,
            usually tailoring a page for the user. Typically, the script in the 
            Web page at the server uses input received as the result of the user's
            request for the page to access data from a database and then builds or
            customizes the page on the fly before sending it to the requestor.
</br>

        (e) What do you mean by CLR?</br>
        Ans.As part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) 
            is programming that manages the execution of programs written in any of
            several supported languages, allowing them to share common 
            object-oriented class es written in any of the languages. The Common
            Language Runtime is somewhat comparable to the Java Virtual Machine that
            Sun Microsystems furnishes for running programs compiled from the Java 
            language. Microsoft refers to its Common Language Runtime as a 
            execution environment." A program compiled for the CLR does not need a
            language-specific execution environment and can easily be moved to and
            run on any system with Windows 2000 or Windows XP 

     </br>   
        (f) What is markup language?</br>
        Ans.Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and
            presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both 
            the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to specify the
            formatting are called tags. HTMLis a an example of a widely known and 
            used markup language</br>

            Types of markup language</br>
            
            There are three main general categories of electronic markup:</br>
            (i)Presentational markup:-The kind of markup used by traditional 
               word-processing systems: binary codes embedded within document text
               that produce the WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") effect.
               Such markup is usually hidden from human users, even authors or 
               editors</br>
            (ii)Procedural markup:-Markup is embedded in text and provides instructions
               for programs that are to process the text. Well-known examples include
               troff, TeX, and PostScript. It is expected that the processor will 
               run through the text from beginning to end, following the instructions
               as encountered.</br>
            (iii)Descriptive markup:-Markup is used to label parts of the document
                 rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be
                 processed. Well-known examples include LaTeX, HTML, and XML. The 
                 objective is to decouple the inherent structure of the document from 
                 any particular treatment or rendition of it.

       </br>
        (g) Why do we use ADO.NET?</br>
        Ans.ADO.NET defines DataSet and DataTable objects which are optimized for
            moving disconnected sets of data across intranets and Internets, including
            through firewalls. It also includes the traditional Connection and Command
            objects, as well as an object called a DataReader that resembles a 
            forward-only, read-only ADO recordset. If you create a new application,
            your application requires some form of data access most of the time.</br>
                                                  This is a simple ADO.NET database
            application that returns results from a database table, writes the output 
            to a DataGrid and TextBoxes, and uses Buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last)
            to navigate through the records</br>
</br>
        (h) Define the structure of C# program.</br>
        Ans.In C#, a structure is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single 
            variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used
            for creating a structure.</br>
            Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of
            your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes
            about each book -</br>
                           Title</br>
                           Author</br>
                           Subject</br>
                           Book ID</br>

            Defining a Structure</br>

            To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement 
            defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program.
            For example, here is the way you can declare the Book structure -
                           struct Books {</br>
                              public string title;</br>
                              public string author;</br>
                              public string subject;</br>
                              public int book_id;</br>
                           };  </br></center><hr/>
</br>
                                                                                            
                                                                                                            <center><font size="5">                        Section-C</br>
                                                                                                                   (Long Answer Type Question)</center></font>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <div align="right"> 5*9=45</div>
Q.3.(a) Explain the architecture of ADO.NET?</br>
    Ans.ADO.NET consist of a set of Objects that expose data access services to the
          .NET environment. It is a data access technology from Microsoft .Net Framework 
          , which provides communication between relational and non relational systems 
          through a common set of components .</br>
          System.Data namespace is the core of ADO.NET and it contains classes used
          by all data providers. ADO.NET is designed to be easy to use, and Visual Studio 
          provides several wizards and other features that you can use to generate
          ADO.NET data access code.</br>
          Data Providers and DataSet
          asp.net-ado.net</br>
          The two key components of ADO.NET are Data Providers and DataSet.
          The Data Provider classes are meant to work with different kinds of data sources.
          They are used to perform all data-management operations on specific databases.
          DataSet class provides mechanisms for managing data when it is disconnected
          from the data source.</br>
          Data Providers</br>
          The .Net Framework includes mainly three Data Providers for ADO.NET.
          They are the Microsoft SQL Server Data Provider , OLEDB Data Provider
          and ODBC Data Provider . SQL Server uses the SqlConnection object , 
          OLEDB uses the OleDbConnection Object and ODBC uses OdbcConnection
          Object respectively.</br>
          ASP.NET SQL Server Connection
          ASP.NET OLEDB Connection</br>
          ASP.NET ODBC Connection</br>
          ASP.NET-dataprovider</br>
          A data provider contains Connection, Command, DataAdapter, and DataReader 
          objects. These four objects provides the functionality of Data Providers in
          the ADO.NET.</br>
          Connection</br>
          The Connection Object provides physical connection to the Data Source.
          Connection object needs the necessary information to recognize the data source 
          and to log on to it properly, this information is provided through a connection 
          string.</br>
          ASP.NET Connection</br>
          Command</br>
          The Command Object uses to perform SQL statement or stored procedure to
          be executed at the Data Source. The command object provides a number of 
          Execute methods that can be used to perform the SQL queries in a variety of 
          fashions.</br>
          ASP.NET Command</br>
          DataReader</br>
          The DataReader Object is a stream-based , forward-only, read-only retrievar
          of query results from the Data Source, which do not update the data.
           DataReader requires a live connection with the databse and provides a very
          intelligent way of consuming all or part of the result set.
          ASP.NET DataReader</br>
          DataAdapter</br>
          DataAdapter Object populate a Dataset Object with results from a Data Source .
          It is a special class whose purpose is to bridge the gap between the disconnected
          Dataset objects and the physical data source.</br>
          ASP.NET DataAdapter</br>
          DataSet</br>
          asp.net-dataset</br>
          DataSet provides a disconnected representation of result sets from the Data Source,
          and it is completely independent from the Data Source. DataSet provides much
          greater flexibility when dealing with related Result Sets.</br>
          DataSet contains rows, columns,primary keys, constraints, and relations with other
          DataTable objects. It consists of a collection of DataTable objects that you can
          relate to each other with DataRelation objects. The DataAdapter Object provides
         a bridge between the DataSet and the Data Source.</br>

</br>
        (b) What is the procedure to create the variable in ASP.</br>
       Ans.Declaring variables in ASP is simple, especially since all variables are of Variant 
              type. What does this mean to you? You don't have to declare if your variable 
              is an integer, string, or object. You just declare it, and it has the potential to
              be anything. To declare a variable in ASP/VBScript we use the Dim   
              statement. If you wanted to print out the variables, you could use the
              ASP 'Response.Write' command.</br>
              In ASP/VBScript, it is possible not to declare variables at all. A variable 
              can appear in the program, though it has never been declared. It is called
              default declaring. Variable in this case will be of Variant type.
              However, such practice leads to errors and should be avoided. For VB
              to consider any form or module variable that was not declared explicitly
             as erroneous, Option Explicit statement should appear in the form or
             module main section before any other statements. Option Explicit demands
             explicit declaration of all variables in this form or module. If module contains
             Option Explicit statement, than upon the attempt to use undeclared or
             incorrectly typed variable name, an error occurs at compile time.
             In naming variables in VBScript you must be aware of these rules:
             Variables must begin with a letter not a number or an underscore
             They cannot have more than 255 characters
             They cannot contain a period (.) , a space or a dash
             They cannot be a predefined identifier (such as dim, variable, if, etc.)
             Case sensitivity is not important in VBScript
             The variable value will be kept in memory for the life span of the current 
             page and will be released from memory when the page has finished executing. 
            To declare variables accessible to more than one ASP file, declare them as 
            session variables or application variables.</br>
</br>
        (c) Describe the diffrence between XML and HTML?</br>
       Ans. Differences between HTML and XML</br>
             1. HTML tags are predefined tags where as XML tags are user defined
                 tags.</br>
             2. HTML tags are limited number of tags where as XML tags are
                 extensible.</br>
             3. HTML tags are case insensitive where as XML tags are sensitive.</br>
             4. HTML tags are meant for displaying the data but not for describing </br>
                 the data where as XML tags are meant for describing the data.</br>
             5. HTML focuses on how data looks where as XML focuses on 
                 what data is.</br>
</br>
        (d) What do you mean by HTML schema? Explain.</br>
        Ans.A schema is a mental concept that informs a person about what to 
              expect from a variety of experiences and situations. Schemas are
              developed based on information provided by life experiences and 
              are then stored in memory. Our brains create and use schemas as 
              a short cut to make future encounters with similar situations easier 
              to navigate. We will look at a couple of examples that will help 
              illustrate the definition.</br>
              These are all languages of code that can be added to HTML to
              embed metadata (schema, for example) on a web document.
              RDFa stands for Resource Descriptive Framework in Attributes.
              It is a form of code that can be added to any HTML, XHTML, 
              and XML-based document.</br>
              RDFa’s attributes include:</br>
              about - to specify the resource the metadata is about
              rel and rev - to specify a relationship and reverse relationship 
              with another resource</br>
              src, href, and resource - to specify a partner resource
              content - to override the content of the element when using the
              property attribut</br>
             datatype - to specify the datatype of text specified for use with
             typeof - to specify the RDF type of the subject or the partner resource
             Microdata implementation is similar to RDFa, and its attributes include
             the following:</br>
             itemscope - to create the item and indicate that the rest of the
            element contains information about it
            itemtype - to describe the item and properties with a valid URL of a
            vocabulary (for example, “https://schema.org”)
            itemprop - to indicate that the containing tag has the value of a
            specified item property (ex, itemprop=”name”)
            itemid - to indicate a unique identifier of the item
            itemref - to reference properties of an element that are not contained in
            the itemscope. This provides a list of element ids with more properties 
            elsewhere in the document</br>
</br>
        (e) How can be create and use data grid view?</br>
        Ans.In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the DataGridView control and
               its supporting classes, in detail. Displaying data in a tabular format is a
               task you are likely to perform frequently. The DataGridView control is
               designed to be a complete solution for displaying tabular data with
               Windows Forms. The DataGridView control is highly configurable and
               extensible, and it provides many properties, methods, and events to
               customize its appearance and behavior.</br>
               The DataGridView control makes it easy to define the basic appearance
               of cells and the display formatting of cell values. The cell is the fundamenta
               unit of interaction for the DataGridView. All cells derive from the 
               DataGridViewCell base class. Each cell within the DataGridView control 
               can have its own style, such as text format, background color, foreground 
               color, and font. Typically, however, multiple cells will share particular style
               characteristics. The data type for the cell's Value property by default is of
               type Object.</br>
               The following chapters explain the basics of DataGridView control and 
               steps through an example that builds simple C# programs. All the source
               code in the following examples ,we chose the Pubs database, which comes
               with SQL Server , as our target database.</br>
</br>
        (f) Explain the following language features-</br>
            
            (i) Type system:-</br>
                                      The type system is dynamic (types are assigned to values, not
               to variables holding them), but strong without surprising coercion rules. 
               The type system is used by the VM to ensure that operands for instructions are
               valid; and can be used by programmers to ensure that parameters passed to
               their functions are valid (i.e. of correct type).</br>
               The type system supports subtyping and multiple inheritance (both features are
               available to programmers), and types are considered when dynamic dispatch of
               methods on objects is used - VM uses types to check by what function is a given
               message implemented for given type.</br>
               The follow-up question was "And how is type assigned to a value?". So I
               explained that all values are boxed, and have a pointer pointing to a type definition
               structure which provides information about name of the type, what messages it
               responds to, and what types it inherits from.</br>
               After that, I got laughed at, and my answer was dismissed with the comment
               "That is not a real typesystem.".         </br>
</br>
             (ii) Interface:-</br>
                                 A user interface, consisting of the set of dials, knobs, operating system 
                 commands, graphical display formats, and other devices provided by a computer
                 or a program to allow the user to communicate and use the computer or program.
                 A graphical user interface (GUI) provides its user a more or less "picture-oriented"
                 way to interact with technology. A GUI is usually a more satisfying or user-friendly 
                 interface to a computer system.</br>
                 A programming interface, consisting of the set of statements, functions, options,
                and other ways of expressing program instructions and data provided by a program
                or language for a programmer to use.</br>
                The physical and logical arrangement supporting the attachment of any device to a
                connector or to another device.</br>
                As a verb, to interface means to communicate with another person or object. 
                With hardware equipment, to interface means making an appropriate physical 
                connection so that two pieces of equipment can communicate or work together
                effectively</br>
</br>
        (g) Describe web application development in detail.</br>
        Ans.Web application development is the process and practice of developing web
               applications.
               Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying
               levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, s
               stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are
               major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern,
               documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural
               description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk.</br>
              
               Practicing code reuse and using web application frameworks can greatly
               improve both productivity and time to market. Reusing externally developed
               components can allow an organization to reap the above benefits, while potentially
               saving money. However, for smaller components, it might be just as easy to 
               develop your own components as it would be to learn new APIs. Also, if a
               component is essential to the business, an organization might want to control 
               its development.</br>

</br>
        (h) Explain the following validation control-</br>
            (i) Calender control:-</br>
                                           The calendar control is a functionally rich web control, which
                 provides the following capabilities:
                 Displaying one month at a time
                 Selecting a day, a week or a month
                 Selecting a range of days
                 Moving from month to month
                 Controlling the display of the days programmatically
                 Working with the Calendar Control
                 Putting a bare-bone calendar control without any code behind file provides a
                 workable calendar to a site, which shows the months and days of the year.
                 It also allows navigation to next and previous months.
                 Calendar</br>
                 Calendar controls allow the users to select a single day, a week, or an entire month. 
                 This is done by using the SelectionMode property. This property has the following 
                 values:</br>

                 Properties	Description</br>

                 Day	To select a single day.
                 DayWeek	To select a single day or an entire week.
                 DayWeekMonth	To select a single day, a week, or an entire month.
                 None	Nothing can be selected
</br>
                 The syntax for selecting days:

                 <asp:Calender ID = "Calendar1" runat = "server" SelectionMode="Day
                 WeekMonth"></br>
                 </asp:Calender></br>

                 When the selection mode is set to the value DayWeekMonth, an extra column with
                 the > symbol appears for selecting the week, and a >> symbol appears to the left of
                 the days name for selecting the month.</br>


            (ii) Intenet Explorer control:-     </br>
                                                       In order to use the IE Web Controls in your ASP.NET Web
                  applications, you must first download the controls' source code and run a build batch 
                  file that will compile the source code and copy all the needed files to the appropriate 
                  Web application directories. The Internet Explorer Web Controls Download Packages
                  is a 360 KB, self-extracting install file.</br>
                  Once you have downloaded and installed the IE Web Controls, a new directory will
                  be created (the default is C:\Program Files\IE Web Controls\, although you can
                 configure it during the installation). Navigate to this new directory and double-click the 
                 build.bat file. This will create a new subdirectory, build, and compile the classes in the
                 src subdirectory, copying the resulting assembly and support files into the build
                 subdirectory.         </br>
