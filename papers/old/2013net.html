    Note: given answer of any five questions.</br></center></font>
</br>    
    Q.2.(a) What is .NET framework?</br>
        Ans.The .NET framework is a software development framework</br>
            from Microsoft. It provides a controlled programming</br>
            environment where software can be developed, installed</br>
            and executed on Windows-based operating systems</br>
</br>
        (b) State the featuers of C#.</br>
        Ans.Definition</br>
            Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal</br>
            state changes. The object will appear to change its</br> 
            class. </br>

            Participants</br>
            The classes and objects participating in this pattern are: </br>
            •Context  (Account) </br>
                          ?defines the interface of interest to clients </br>
                          ?maintains an instance of a ConcreteState</br>
                           subclass that defines the current state.</br>
            •State  (State) </br>
                          ?defines an interface for encapsulating the</br>
                           behavior associated with a particular state </br>
                           of the Context.</br>
            •Concrete State  (RedState, SilverState, GoldState) </br>
                          ?each subclass implements a behavior </br>
                          associated with a state of Context</br>

</br>
        (c) Where should we use XML?</br>
        Ans.Here are a few reasons for using XMLL:-</br>
            •XML can be used to describe and identify information </br>
             accurately and unambiguously, in a way that computers can be</br>
             programmed to ‘understand’ your information (well, at least </br>
             manipulate as if they could understand it).</br>
            •XML allows sets of documents which are all the same type to</br>
             be created and handled consistently and without structural </br>
             errors, because it provides a standardised way of describing,</br>
             controlling, or allowing/disallowing particular types of</br>
             document structure. [Note that this has absolutely nothing</br>
             whatever to do with formatting, appearance, or the actual text</br>
             or data content of your documents, only the structure of them.</br>
             If you want styling or formatting, see How do I control the</br>
             formatting of XML?.]</br>
            •XML provides a robust and durable format for information </br>
             storage and transmission. Robust because it is based on a</br>
             proven standard, and can thus be tested and verified; durable</br> 
             (persistent) because it uses plain-text file formats which will</br>
             outlast proprietary binary ones.</br>
            •XML provides a common syntax for messaging systems for the </br>
             exchange of information between applications. Previously, each </br>
             messaging system had its own format and all were different,</br>
             which made inter-system messaging unnecessarily messy, complex,</br>
             and expensive. If everyone uses the same syntax it makes writing </br>
             these systems much faster and more reliable.</br>
            •XML is free. Not just free of charge (free as in beer) but free </br>
             of legal encumbrances (free as in speech). It doesn't belong to</br>
             anyone, so it can't be hijacked or pirated. And you don't have to</br>
             pay a fee to use it (you can of course choose to use commercial</br>
             software to deal with it, for lots of good reasons, but you don't
             pay for XML itself).</br>
            •XML information can be manipulated programmatically (under machine</br>
             control), so XML documents can be pieced together from disparate </br>
             sources, or taken apart and re-used in different ways. They can be</br>
             converted into any other format with no loss of information.</br>
            •XML lets you separate form (appearance) from content. Your XML file </br>
             contains your document information (text, data) and identifies its </br>
             structure: your formatting and other processing needs are identified</br>
             separately in a stylesheet or processing system. The two are combined</br>
             at output time to apply the required formatting to the text or data</br>
             identified by its structure.</br>
            •Any of the Design Goals listed in the XML Specification</br>


</br>
        (d) What is ASP?</br>
        Ans.An Active Server Page (ASP) is an HTML page that includes one or more</br>
            scripts (small embedded programs) that are processed on a Microsoft</br>
            Web server before the page is sent to the user. An ASP is somewhat</br>
            similar to a server-side include or a common gateway interface (CGI)</br>
            application in that all involve programs that run on the server,</br>
            usually tailoring a page for the user. Typically, the script in the </br>
            Web page at the server uses input received as the result of the user's</br> 
            request for the page to access data from a database and then builds or</br>
            customizes the page on the fly before sending it to the requestor.</br>
</br>

        (e) What do you mean by CLR?</br>
        Ans.As part of Microsoft's .NET Framework, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) </br> 
            is programming that manages the execution of programs written in any of</br>
            several supported languages, allowing them to share common </br>
            object-oriented class es written in any of the languages. The Common</br>
            Language Runtime is somewhat comparable to the Java Virtual Machine that</br>
            Sun Microsystems furnishes for running programs compiled from the Java </br>
            language. Microsoft refers to its Common Language Runtime as a </br>
            execution environment." A program compiled for the CLR does not need a</br>
            language-specific execution environment and can easily be moved to and</br>
            run on any system with Windows 2000 or Windows XP </br>

     </br>   
        (f) What is markup language?</br>
        Ans.Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and</br>
            presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both </br>
            the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to specify the</br>
            formatting are called tags. HTMLis a an example of a widely known and </br>
            used markup language</br>

            Types of markup language</br>
            
            There are three main general categories of electronic markup:</br>
            (i)Presentational markup:-The kind of markup used by traditional </br>
               word-processing systems: binary codes embedded within document text</br>
               that produce the WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") effect.</br>
               Such markup is usually hidden from human users, even authors or </br>
               editors</br>
            (ii)Procedural markup:-Markup is embedded in text and provides instructions</br>
               for programs that are to process the text. Well-known examples include </br>
               troff, TeX, and PostScript. It is expected that the processor will </br>
               run through the text from beginning to end, following the instructions</br>
               as encountered.</br>
            (iii)Descriptive markup:-Markup is used to label parts of the document </br>
                 rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be</br>
                 processed. Well-known examples include LaTeX, HTML, and XML. The </br>
                 objective is to decouple the inherent structure of the document from </br>
                 any particular treatment or rendition of it.</br>

       </br>
        (g) Why do we use ADO.NET?</br>
        Ans.ADO.NET defines DataSet and DataTable objects which are optimized for</br>
            moving disconnected sets of data across intranets and Internets, including</br>
            through firewalls. It also includes the traditional Connection and Command</br>
            objects, as well as an object called a DataReader that resembles a </br>
            forward-only, read-only ADO recordset. If you create a new application,</br>
            your application requires some form of data access most of the time.</br>
                                                  This is a simple ADO.NET database</br>
            application that returns results from a database table, writes the output </br>
            to a DataGrid and TextBoxes, and uses Buttons (First, Previous, Next, Last)</br>
            to navigate through the records</br>
</br>
        (h) Define the structure of C# program.</br>
        Ans.In C#, a structure is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single </br>
            variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used</br>
            for creating a structure.</br>
            Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of</br>
            your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes</br>
            about each book -</br>
                           Title</br>
                           Author</br>
                           Subject</br>
                           Book ID</br>

            Defining a Structure</br>

            To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement </br>
            defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program.</br>
            For example, here is the way you can declare the Book structure -</br>
                           struct Books {</br>
                              public string title;</br>
                              public string author;</br>
                              public string subject;</br>
                              public int book_id;</br>
                           };  </br></center><hr/>

</br>
    Q.3.(a) Explain the architecture of ADO.NET?</br>
    Ans.ADO.NET consist of a set of Objects that expose data access services to the</br>
          .NET environment. It is a data access technology from Microsoft .Net Framework </br>
          , which provides communication between relational and non relational systems </br>
          through a common set of components .</br>
          System.Data namespace is the core of ADO.NET and it contains classes used</br>
          by all data providers. ADO.NET is designed to be easy to use, and Visual Studio </br>
          provides several wizards and other features that you can use to generate</br>
          ADO.NET data access code.</br>
          Data Providers and DataSet</br>
          asp.net-ado.net</br>
          The two key components of ADO.NET are Data Providers and DataSet.</br>
          The Data Provider classes are meant to work with different kinds of data sources.</br>
          They are used to perform all data-management operations on specific databases.</br>
          DataSet class provides mechanisms for managing data when it is disconnected</br>
          from the data source.</br>
          Data Providers</br>
          The .Net Framework includes mainly three Data Providers for ADO.NET.</br>
          They are the Microsoft SQL Server Data Provider , OLEDB Data Provider</br>
          and ODBC Data Provider . SQL Server uses the SqlConnection object , </br>
          OLEDB uses the OleDbConnection Object and ODBC uses OdbcConnection</br>
          Object respectively.</br>
          ASP.NET SQL Server Connection</br>
          ASP.NET OLEDB Connection</br>
          ASP.NET ODBC Connection</br>
          ASP.NET-dataprovider</br>
          A data provider contains Connection, Command, DataAdapter, and DataReader </br>
          objects. These four objects provides the functionality of Data Providers in</br>
          the ADO.NET.</br>
          Connection</br>
          The Connection Object provides physical connection to the Data Source.</br>
          Connection object needs the necessary information to recognize the data source </br>
          and to log on to it properly, this information is provided through a connection </br>
          string.</br>
          ASP.NET Connection</br>
          Command</br>
          The Command Object uses to perform SQL statement or stored procedure to</br>
          be executed at the Data Source. The command object provides a number of </br>
          Execute methods that can be used to perform the SQL queries in a variety of </br>
          fashions.</br>
          ASP.NET Command</br>
          DataReader</br>
          The DataReader Object is a stream-based , forward-only, read-only retrievar</br>
          of query results from the Data Source, which do not update the data.</br>
           DataReader requires a live connection with the databse and provides a very</br>
          intelligent way of consuming all or part of the result set.</br>
          ASP.NET DataReader</br>
          DataAdapter</br>
          DataAdapter Object populate a Dataset Object with results from a Data Source .</br>
          It is a special class whose purpose is to bridge the gap between the disconnected</br>
          Dataset objects and the physical data source.</br>
          ASP.NET DataAdapter</br>
          DataSet</br>
          asp.net-dataset</br>
          DataSet provides a disconnected representation of result sets from the Data Source,</br>
          and it is completely independent from the Data Source. DataSet provides much</br>
          greater flexibility when dealing with related Result Sets.</br>
          DataSet contains rows, columns,primary keys, constraints, and relations with other</br>
          DataTable objects. It consists of a collection of DataTable objects that you can</br>
          relate to each other with DataRelation objects. The DataAdapter Object provides</br>
         a bridge between the DataSet and the Data Source.</br>

</br>
        (b) What is the procedure to create the variable in ASP.</br>
       Ans.Declaring variables in ASP is simple, especially since all variables are of Variant </br>
              type. What does this mean to you? You don't have to declare if your variable </br>
              is an integer, string, or object. You just declare it, and it has the potential to</br>
              be anything. To declare a variable in ASP/VBScript we use the Dim   </br>
              statement. If you wanted to print out the variables, you could use the</br>
              ASP 'Response.Write' command.</br>
              In ASP/VBScript, it is possible not to declare variables at all. A variable </br>
              can appear in the program, though it has never been declared. It is called</br>
              default declaring. Variable in this case will be of Variant type.</br>
              However, such practice leads to errors and should be avoided. For VB</br>
              to consider any form or module variable that was not declared explicitly</br>
             as erroneous, Option Explicit statement should appear in the form or</br>
             module main section before any other statements. Option Explicit demands</br>
             explicit declaration of all variables in this form or module. If module contains</br>
             Option Explicit statement, than upon the attempt to use undeclared or</br>
             incorrectly typed variable name, an error occurs at compile time.</br>
             In naming variables in VBScript you must be aware of these rules:</br>
             Variables must begin with a letter not a number or an underscore</br>
             They cannot have more than 255 characters</br>
             They cannot contain a period (.) , a space or a dash</br>
             They cannot be a predefined identifier (such as dim, variable, if, etc.)</br>
             Case sensitivity is not important in VBScript</br>
             The variable value will be kept in memory for the life span of the current </br>
             page and will be released from memory when the page has finished executing. </br>
            To declare variables accessible to more than one ASP file, declare them as </br>
            session variables or application variables.</br>
</br>
        (c) Describe the diffrence between XML and HTML?</br>
       Ans. Differences between HTML and XML</br>
             1. HTML tags are predefined tags where as XML tags are user defined</br>
                 tags.</br>
             2. HTML tags are limited number of tags where as XML tags are</br>
                 extensible.</br>
             3. HTML tags are case insensitive where as XML tags are sensitive.</br>
             4. HTML tags are meant for displaying the data but not for describing </br>
                 the data where as XML tags are meant for describing the data.</br>
             5. HTML focuses on how data looks where as XML focuses on </br>
                 what data is.</br>
</br>
        (d) What do you mean by HTML schema? Explain.</br>
        Ans.A schema is a mental concept that informs a person about what to </br>
              expect from a variety of experiences and situations. Schemas are</br>
              developed based on information provided by life experiences and </br>
              are then stored in memory. Our brains create and use schemas as </br>
              a short cut to make future encounters with similar situations easier </br>
              to navigate. We will look at a couple of examples that will help </br>
              illustrate the definition.</br>
              These are all languages of code that can be added to HTML to</br>
              embed metadata (schema, for example) on a web document.</br>
              RDFa stands for Resource Descriptive Framework in Attributes.</br>
              It is a form of code that can be added to any HTML, XHTML, </br>
              and XML-based document.</br>
              RDFa’s attributes include:</br>
              about - to specify the resource the metadata is about</br>
              rel and rev - to specify a relationship and reverse relationship </br>
              with another resource</br>
              src, href, and resource - to specify a partner resource</br>
              content - to override the content of the element when using the</br>
              property attribut</br>
             datatype - to specify the datatype of text specified for use with</br>
             typeof - to specify the RDF type of the subject or the partner resource</br>
             Microdata implementation is similar to RDFa, and its attributes include</br>
             the following:</br>
             itemscope - to create the item and indicate that the rest of the</br>
            element contains information about it</br></br>
            itemtype - to describe the item and properties with a valid URL of a</br>
            vocabulary (for example, “https://schema.org”)</br>
            itemprop - to indicate that the containing tag has the value of a</br>
            specified item property (ex, itemprop=”name”)</br>
            itemid - to indicate a unique identifier of the item</br>
            itemref - to reference properties of an element that are not contained in</br>
            the itemscope. This provides a list of element ids with more properties </br>
            elsewhere in the document</br>
</br>
        (e) How can be create and use data grid view?</br>
        Ans.In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the DataGridView control and</br>
               its supporting classes, in detail. Displaying data in a tabular format is a</br>
               task you are likely to perform frequently. The DataGridView control is</br>
               designed to be a complete solution for displaying tabular data with</br>
               Windows Forms. The DataGridView control is highly configurable and</br>
               extensible, and it provides many properties, methods, and events to</br>
               customize its appearance and behavior.</br>
               The DataGridView control makes it easy to define the basic appearance</br>
               of cells and the display formatting of cell values. The cell is the fundamental</br>
               unit of interaction for the DataGridView. All cells derive from the </br>
               DataGridViewCell base class. Each cell within the DataGridView control </br>
               can have its own style, such as text format, background color, foreground </br>
               color, and font. Typically, however, multiple cells will share particular style</br>
               characteristics. The data type for the cell's Value property by default is of</br>
               type Object.</br>
               The following chapters explain the basics of DataGridView control and </br>
               steps through an example that builds simple C# programs. All the source</br>
               code in the following examples ,we chose the Pubs database, which comes</br>
               with SQL Server , as our target database.</br>
</br>
        (f) Explain the following language features-</br>
            
            (i) Type system:-</br>
                                      The type system is dynamic (types are assigned to values, not</br>
               to variables holding them), but strong without surprising coercion rules. </br>
               The type system is used by the VM to ensure that operands for instructions are</br>
               valid; and can be used by programmers to ensure that parameters passed to </br>
               their functions are valid (i.e. of correct type).</br>
               The type system supports subtyping and multiple inheritance (both features are</br>
               available to programmers), and types are considered when dynamic dispatch of</br>
               methods on objects is used - VM uses types to check by what function is a given</br>
               message implemented for given type.</br>
               The follow-up question was "And how is type assigned to a value?". So I</br>
               explained that all values are boxed, and have a pointer pointing to a type definition</br>
               structure which provides information about name of the type, what messages it</br>
               responds to, and what types it inherits from.</br>
               After that, I got laughed at, and my answer was dismissed with the comment</br>
               "That is not a real typesystem.".         </br>
</br>
             (ii) Interface:-</br>
                                 A user interface, consisting of the set of dials, knobs, operating system </br>
                 commands, graphical display formats, and other devices provided by a computer</br>
                 or a program to allow the user to communicate and use the computer or program.</br>
                 A graphical user interface (GUI) provides its user a more or less "picture-oriented"</br>
                 way to interact with technology. A GUI is usually a more satisfying or user-friendly </br>
                 interface to a computer system.</br>
                 A programming interface, consisting of the set of statements, functions, options,</br>
                and other ways of expressing program instructions and data provided by a program</br>
                or language for a programmer to use.</br>
                The physical and logical arrangement supporting the attachment of any device to a</br>
                connector or to another device.</br>
                As a verb, to interface means to communicate with another person or object. </br>
                With hardware equipment, to interface means making an appropriate physical </br>
                connection so that two pieces of equipment can communicate or work together</br>
                effectively</br>
</br>
        (g) Describe web application development in detail.</br>
        Ans.Web application development is the process and practice of developing web </br>
               applications.</br>
               Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying</br>
               levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a</br>
               stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are</br>
               major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern,</br>
               documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural </br>
               description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk.</br>
              
               Practicing code reuse and using web application frameworks can greatly</br>
               improve both productivity and time to market. Reusing externally developed</br>
               components can allow an organization to reap the above benefits, while potentially</br>
               saving money. However, for smaller components, it might be just as easy to </br>
               develop your own components as it would be to learn new APIs. Also, if a</br>
               component is essential to the business, an organization might want to control </br>
               its development.</br>

</br>
        (h) Explain the following validation control-</br>
            (i) Calender control:-</br>
                                           The calendar control is a functionally rich web control, which</br>
                 provides the following capabilities:</br>
                 Displaying one month at a time</br>
                 Selecting a day, a week or a month</br>
                 Selecting a range of days</br>
                 Moving from month to month</br>
                 Controlling the display of the days programmatically</br>
                 Working with the Calendar Control</br>
                 Putting a bare-bone calendar control without any code behind file provides a</br>
                 workable calendar to a site, which shows the months and days of the year.</br>
                 It also allows navigation to next and previous months.</br>
                 Calendar</br>
                 Calendar controls allow the users to select a single day, a week, or an entire month. </br>
                 This is done by using the SelectionMode property. This property has the following </br>
                 values:</br>

                 Properties	Description</br>

                 Day	To select a single day.</br>
                 DayWeek	To select a single day or an entire week.</br>
                 DayWeekMonth	To select a single day, a week, or an entire month.</br>
                 None	Nothing can be selected.</br>
</br>
                 The syntax for selecting days:</br>

                 <asp:Calender ID = "Calendar1" runat = "server" SelectionMode="Day</br>
                 WeekMonth"></br>
                 </asp:Calender></br>

                 When the selection mode is set to the value DayWeekMonth, an extra column with</br>
                 the > symbol appears for selecting the week, and a >> symbol appears to the left of</br>
                 the days name for selecting the month.</br>


            (ii) Intenet Explorer control:-     </br>
                                                       In order to use the IE Web Controls in your ASP.NET Web</br>
                  applications, you must first download the controls' source code and run a build batch </br>
                  file that will compile the source code and copy all the needed files to the appropriate </br>
                  Web application directories. The Internet Explorer Web Controls Download Packages</br>
                  is a 360 KB, self-extracting install file.</br>
                  Once you have downloaded and installed the IE Web Controls, a new directory will</br>
                  be created (the default is C:\Program Files\IE Web Controls\, although you can</br>
                 configure it during the installation). Navigate to this new directory and double-click the </br>
                 build.bat file. This will create a new subdirectory, build, and compile the classes in the</br>
                 src subdirectory, copying the resulting assembly and support files into the build</br> 
                 subdirectory.         </br>
