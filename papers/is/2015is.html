Q.2.What is the use of Steganography?
</br>
Ans- </font>STEGANOGRAPHY- Steganography (from Greek steganos, or "covered," and graphie, or "writing") is the hiding of a secret
 message within an ordinary message and the extraction of it at its destination. Steganography takes cryptography a step farther by hiding
 an encrypted message so that no one suspects it exists. 
Ideally, anyone scanning your data will fail to know it contains encrypted data.
                                                                     
Steganography  is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. 
The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos</br>
 (,meaning "covered, concealed, or protected," and graphein  meaning "writing").
</br></br><font size="5">
Q.3.What do you understand by Authentication?
</br>
Ans- </font>AUTHENTICATION-         Authentication is the process of recognizing a user’s identity. It is the 
  mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials.
 The credentials provided are compared to those on a file in a database of the authorized
 user’s information on a local operating system or within an authentication server.
    The authentication process always runs at the start of the application, before the
 permission and throttling checks occur, and before any other code is allowed to proceed. 
Different systems may require different types of credentials to ascertain a user's identity.
In the context of computer systems, authentication is a process that ensures and confirms a user's identity. 
Authentication is one of the five pillars of information assurance (IA). </br>
The other four are integrity, availability, confidentiality and nonrepudiation.
           </br></br><font size="5">
Q.4.Explain the term Integrity?
</br>
Ans- </font>INTEGRITY- Integrity is the qualification of being honest and having strong moral principles, or moral uprightness. 
It is generally a personal choice to hold oneself to consistent moral and ethical standards.
          </br>                                                               OR
Integrity is a term used to describe a person's level of honesty, moral commitments,
 and willingness to do what's right. For example, we expect our doctors to be honest with
 us about diagnoses, won't try to prescribe medications we don't need, and will generally 
work in the best interest of our health and well-being. We expect this because, in most societies, 
doctors are perceived to be people of great integrity with strong moral compasses.
</br></br><font size="5">
Q.5.Why there is need of Computer Security?
</br>
Ans-  </font>COMPUTER SECURITY- The protection of data, networks and computing power.
 The protection of data (information security) is the most important.
 The protection of networks is important to prevent loss of server resources as 
 well as to protect the network from being used for illegal purposes.
</br>
      NEED OF COMPUTER SECURITY-
 Computer security is important, primarily to keep your information protected. Its also
 important for your computer’s overall health, helping to prevent viruses and malware and helping
 programs run more smoothly. 
</br>
 Protects the organizations ability to function</br>
 Enables the safe operation of applications</br>
     implemented on the organizations IT systems</br>
 Protects the data the organization collects and uses</br>
 Safeguards the technology assets in use at the organization.</br>
</br><font size="5">
Q.6.What do you understand by Threats?
</br>
Ans-</font> THREATS- In computer security, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability 
to breach security and therefore cause possible harm.
A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e. hacking: an individual cracker or a criminal organization) 
or "accidental" (e.g. the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of a natural disaster such 
as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado) or otherwise a circumstance, capability, action, or event.
</br>
       THREAT CLASSIFICATION-</br>
Microsoft has proposed a threat classification called STRIDE,[14] from the initials of threat categories:
</br>
1)Spoofing of user identity</br>
2)Tampering</br>
3)Repudiation</br>
4)Information disclosure (privacy breach or Data leak)</br>
5)Denial of Service (D.o.S.)</br>
6)Elevation of privilege</br>
</br><font size="5">
Q.7.What are worms?Explain its drawback?
</br>
Ans- </font>WORMS- A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order
 to spread to other computers.Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures
 on the target computer to access it. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if 
only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
          </br>         Many worms that have been created are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change
 the systems they pass through. 
</br>
DRAWBACK OF WORMS-
</br>
-Viruses can cause many problems on your computer. Usually, they display pop-up ads on your desktop or steal
 your information. Some of the more nasty ones can even crash your computer or delete your files.
</br>
-Your computer gets slowed down 
</br>
-Some the applications wont start(ex: I hate mozilla virus wont let you start the mozilla) You can not see some 
of the settings in your OS( ex one kind of virus disables hide folder options and you will never be able to set it)
</br>
-Many "hackers" get jobs with software firms by finding and exploiting problems with software.

Q.8.Explain design principle of block cipher?Discuss with the help of example?
</br>
Ans- </font>BLOCK CIPHER DESIGN PRINCIPLES
</br>
 Although much progress has been made in designing block ciphers that are cryptographically strong,
 the basic principles have not changed all that much since the  work of Feistel and the DES design team
 in the early 1970s. It is useful to begin this discussion by looking at the published design criteria 
used in the DES effort. </br>
Then  we look at three critical aspects of block cipher design: 
</br>
1)the number of rounds</br>
2)design of the function F</br>
3)key  scheduling.</br>
</br>
 A Block Cipher is one in which a block of plaintext is treated as a whole and used to produce 
a ciphertext block of equal length. </br>
Example of the block cipher-</br>
  DES.</br>

  PRINCIPLES OF BLOCK CIPHER-</br>

1)A block cipher operates on a plaintext block of n bits to produce a ciphertext block of n bits.</br>
2)There are 2r possible different plaintext blocks and for the encryption to be reversible 
each must produce unique ciphertext block.</br>
3)Reversible encryption is also called as singular encryption. For example singular and 
non-singular transformation for n=2.</br>
</br><font size="5">
Q.9.How can we say that cryptography is a weapon to secure data?
</br>
Ans- </font>Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek ???pt?? kryptós, "hidden, secret"; 
and ???fe?? graphein, "to write", or -????a -logia, "study", respectively) is the practice
 and study of techniques for secure communication in the presenceof third parties called
 adversaries.More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols 
that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in
 information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and
 non-repudiationare central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the
 intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, 
communication science, and physics.
 </br>
APPLICATION OF CRYPTOGRAPHY-
</br>
 1) Electronic commerce</br>
 2) Chip-based payment cards digital currencies</br>
 3) Computer passwords</br>
 4) Military communications</br>.
 
Cryptography is an essential information security tool. </br>
It provides the four most basic services of information security -</br>

1)Confidentiality - Encryption technique can guard the information and communication
 from unauthorized revelation and access of information.</br>

2)Authentication - The cryptographic techniques such as MAC and digital signatures
 can protect information against spoofing and forgeries.</br>

3)Data Integrity - The cryptographic hash functions are playing vital role in assuring 
the users about the data integrity.</br>

4)Non-repudiation - The digital signature provides the non-repudiation service to guard 
against the dispute that may arise due to denial of passing message by the sender.</br>

Q.10.What are the important points to be considered in web security?</br>
</br>
Ans- </font>IMPORTANT POINTS IN WEB SECURITY-
</br>
  1)  Set a unique password for your administrator account – Some Windows flavors
 come with a built-in administator account with no password. This is the easiest way to allow
 a hacker to hijack your computer. You need to set it to something, and it needs to be something
 hard to guess (more about picking passwords later). 
To set it, go to Start -> Control Panel. </br>

 2)  Use strong passwords – Setting your password is a waste of time if it can be guessed.
 What should you not use as a password? Anything that your closest friend could ever, EVER, guess.
 So don’t use your name, birthday, relative’s name, etc. Don’t use “password”, “123”, etc.
 Don’t make your password something you would find in a dictionary.</br>

 3)  Install an antivirus product – Everyone should have some sort of antivirus installed.
 More importantly, it should be up-to-date. This usually costs around $40 for a year or 2,
 but it is worth it. There are some free antivirus tools out there, but I have never used them,
 so I can’t offer any opinion on them.</br>

 4) Install (and configure) a software firewall – A lot of the antivirus suites come with a firewall. 
If your’s didn’t, find another one. There are a ton online, and I haven’t used enough of them to 
offer a recommendation of one over the others.</br> 

 5) Turn on auto-updates – Both your operating system and your browser should have auto-updating 
capabilities. This means when a new version is released, you get it automatically, instead of having to
 go look for it. The most common reason for a new version of software is a patched vulnerability.  </br></br>
<font size="5">
Q.11.What are the function of firewall and explain its type also?</br>

Ans- </font>FIREWALL- </br>
               </br>  In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming 
and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a
 barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet.
                    </br>                                             OR
  A firewall is software or firmware that enforces a set of rules about what data packets will be
 allowed to enter or leave a network. Firewalls are incorporated into a wide variety of networked
 devices to filter traffic and lower the risk that malicious packets traveling over the public internet
 can impact the security of a private network.
</br>
FUNCTION OF FIREWALL-
</br>
1) Firewall is a software or hardware device that protects your computer from being attacked over
 the internet by hackers, viruses, and worms. </br>
2)A firewall in each company’s internet connection allows the business to setup online rules for the users. 
</br>
TYPES OF FIREWALL-
</br>
1)Packet filtering firewalls :-</br>

 The original type of firewall, operates inline at junction points where devices such as routers and switches
 do their work.However, this firewall doesn't route packets, but instead compares each packet received to 
 a set of established criteria -- such as the allowed IP addresses, packet type, port number, etc. Packets that 
 are flagged as troublesome are, generally speaking, unceremoniously dropped -- that is, they are not forwarded 
 and, thus, cease to exist.
</br>
2)Circuit-level gateways 
</br>
Using another relatively quick way to identify malicious content, these devices monitor the TCP handshakes 
across the network as they are established between the local and remote hosts to determine whether
 the session being initiated is legitimate -- whether the remote system is considered trusted. 
</br>
3)Stateful inspection firewalls
</br>
State-aware devices, on the other hand, not only examine each packet, but also keep track of whether
 or not that packet is part of an established TCP session. This offers more security than either 
packet filtering or circuit monitoring alone, but exacts a greater toll on network performance.
</br>
4)Application-level gateways 
</br>
This kind of device, technically a proxy, and sometimes referred to as a proxy firewall, combines 
some of the attributes of packet filtering firewalls with those of circuit-level gateways. They filter packets
 not only according to the service for which they are intended -- as specified by the destination port -- but 
also by certain other characteristics, such as the HTTP request string.
</br>
5)Next-gen firewalls 
</br>
This looser category is the most recent -- and least-well delineated -- of the types of firewalls. A typical
 next-gen product combines packet inspection with stateful inspection, but also includes some variety of
 deep packet inspection.

Q.12.Describe RSA Algorithm in detail?
</br>
Ans- </font>RSA-
     </br>        RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used 
 for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from
 the decryption key which is kept secret (private). In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty
 of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem". The acronym RSA is
 made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest,Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly
 described the algorithm in 1978. 
         </br>            RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this, it is less commonly used to directly encrypt
 user data. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptographywhich in turn can
 perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed.
</br>
Description of Algorithm:
</br>
1) The scheme developed by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman makes use of an expression with exponentials.
</br>2) Plaintext is encrypted in block having a binary value than same number n.
</br>3) Block Size =log2(n)=log2?(n)
</br>4) If block size=1 bits then, 21=n=2i+121=n=2i+1
</br>5) Encryption and decryption are of following form for same plaintext M and ciphertext C.

C=MemodnC=Memodn
</br>
M=CdmodnM=Cdmodn
</br>
M=(Me)dmodnM=(Me)dmodn
</br>
M=MedmodnM=Medmodn
Both sender and receiver must know the value of n.
</br>
The sender knows the value of e, and only the receiver knows the value of d.
Thus this is a public key encryption algorithm with a public key of PU= {c, n} and private key of PR= {d, n}.

Q.13.How trojan horse is different from Malware?
</br>
Ans -</font> Malware can include viruses, adware, nagware, spyware, worms, trojan horses,
 and many other types of malicious software. This means that viruses and Trojan horses
 are types of malware; they all fall under the category of malware (“malicious software”).
</br>
MALWARE:-
This is a big catchall phrase that covers all sorts of software with nasty intent. Not buggy software,
 not programs you don’t like, but software which is specifically written with the intent to harm.
     </br>                    Malware is a type of software (a piece of code) that is written specifically to infect or 
harm the system on which it runs (i.e. the host system). It’s basically an umbrella term used to refer to a wide
 range of intrusive or disruptive types of software that can adversely affect the performance of your system.
          </br>               Malware can include viruses, adware, nagware, spyware, worms, trojan horses, and many
 other types of malicious software. This means that viruses and Trojan horses are types of malware; they
 all fall under the category of malware (“malicious software”).
</br>
TROJAN HORSE-
</br>A Trojan horse is a malicious program that misrepresents itself and appears to be regular, harmless software.
 Unfortunately, this has hugely negative effects on the host computer. 
</br>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.
 Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. 
Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems.
