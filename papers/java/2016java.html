 <font size="5">Q1.    Explain various primitive data types used in Java.
			                     </br> OR</br>
   Explain arithmetic operator with their precedence.</br>
  Answer-</font> The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used.</br> 
  This involves stating the variable's type and name, as you've already seen:</br>
Integer = 1;</br>
byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
 It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.
 Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values. The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:
</br>short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a 232-1 which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of

</br>int: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
 
long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use thelong data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1
</br>float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification  
double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification.  
</br>boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).
</br><font size="5">Q2.In what ways does switch statement differ from an if statement?
                                            </br>OR</br>
Write an programe that computer and prints a table of factorial for any given number m.</br>
Answer- </font>Key Difference: The if statement is uses a Boolean expression to execute the function and can often be used to check multiple conditions at a time. The switch statement uses a int expression to check each cause to see if it satisfies the conditions, if it does the statement will execute the code.


Many budding engi neers and programming enthusiasts come across this question when they start learning about computer programming, and are often stunned by it. In both statements the runtime evaluates each expression in a series until it finds one that is true, at which point it executes the code corresponding to the case. If the expression is false, then the statement shifts to the second case provided.
 
Both the functions are often used for different reasons though. The if statement is uses a Boolean expression to execute the function and can often be used to check multiple conditions at a time.
Comparison between if Statement and switch Statement:
 	if Statement	switch Statement
Language	Java	Java
Field	Computer Programming	Computer Programming
Type of expression used	Boolean	Int
Conditions	Can be used check multiple conditions at a time	Can be used to check a single condition at a time
Organized	If more conditions are used, it is more difficult to understand	Even if the number of conditions increase, switch statement is still easier to understand
Nesting	Popular for nesting of a loop	Not as popular for nesting of a loop
Used for	Comparing string vs string	Comparing int, byte, char, long, short, and enum

Q3. How objects are created in java .
                     </br> OR</br>
Write about the constructor in java with example.
Answer. </font>There are five total ways to create objects in Java, which are explained below with their examples followed by bytecode of the line which is creating the object.
If you will execute program given in end, you will see method 1, 2, 3 uses the constructor to create the object while 4, 5 doesn’t call the constructor to create the object. 
</br>1. Using new keywords
It is the most common and regular way to create an object and a very simple one also. By using this method we can call whichever constructor we want to call.
</br>
2. Using newInstance() method of Class class 
We can also use the newInstance() method of a Class class to create an object. This newInstance() method calls the no-arg constructor to create the object.
</br>
3. Using newInstance() method of Constructor class 
Similar to the newInstance() method of Class class, There is one newInstance() method in the java.lang.reflect.Constructor class which we can use to create objects. We can also call parameterized constructor, and private constructor by using this newInstance() method.
</br>
4. Using clone() method: 
Whenever we call clone() on any object, the JVM actually creates a new object for us and copies all content of the previous object into it. Creating an object using the clone method does not invoke any constructor. 
To use clone() method on an object we need to implement Cloneable and define the clone() method in it. 

</br>
5. Using deserialization: 
Whenever we serialize and deserialize an object, the JVM creates a separate object for us. In deserialization, the JVM doesn’t use any constructor to create the object. 
To deserialize an object we need to implement a Serializable interface in our class. 
</br>
Example
Let’s consider an Employee class for which we are going to create the objects:
 the below Java program we are going to create Employee objects in all 5 ways. You can also find the source code at GitHub. 
</br></br><font size="5">Q4.  How super keyword is used in java.
                               </br>Or  </br>
What do you understand by exception handling in java.</br>
Answer.</font>
The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.  The keyword “super” came into the picture with the concept of Inheritance. It is majorly used in the following contexts:
</br>1. Use of super with variables: This scenario occurs when a derived class and base class has same data members. In that case there is a possibility of ambiguity for the JVM. We can understand it more clearly using this code snippet:
/* Base class vehicle */
</br>class Vehicle</br>
{</br>
    int maxSpeed = 120;</br>
}</br>
 
/* sub class Car extending vehicle */
</br>class Car extends Vehicle
</br>{</br>
    int maxSpeed = 180;
 </br>
    void display()
    {
        /* print maxSpeed of base class (vehicle) */
        System.out.println("Maximum Speed: " + super.maxSpeed);
    </br>}</br>
}</br>
 
/* Driver program to test */
</br>class Test
</br>{</br>
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {</br>
        Car small = new Car();</br>
        small.display();</br>
    }</br>
}</br>
Run on IDE</br>
Output:</br>
Maximum Speed: 120</br> 



2. Use of super with methods: This is used when we want to call parent class method. This code snippet helps to understand the said usage of super keyword.
</br>/* Base class Person */
class Person
</br>{
    </br>void message()
    {
       </br> System.out.println("This is person class");
   </br> }</br>
}
 </br>
/* Subclass Student */
class Student extends Person
{</br>
    void message()
    </br>{
        System.out.println("This is student class");
    </br>}
 
    </br>// Note that display() is only in Student class
    </br>void display()
    </br>{
        </br>// will invoke or call current class message() method
        </br>message();
 
        </br>// will invoke or call parent class message() method
        </br>super.message();
    }</br>
}</br>
 
</br>/* Driver program to test */
</br>class Test
{</br>
    public static void main(String args[])
    </br>{</br>
        Student s = new Student();
 
        // calling display() of Student
        s.display();
    </br>}
}
</br>Run on IDE
</br>Output:
</br>This is student class
</br>This is person class
 
</br>3. Use of super with constructors: super keyword can also be used to access the parent class constructor. One more important thing is that, ‘’super’ can call both parametric as well as non parametric constructors depending upon the situation. Following is the code snippet to explain the above concept:
</br>/* superclass Person */
class Person
{</br>
    Person()
    {</br>
        </br>System.out.println("Person class Constructor");
    }</br>
}</br>
 
</br>/* subclass Student extending the Person class */
</br>class Student extends Person
{</br>
    Student()
    </br>{
    </br>    // invoke or call parent class constructor
      </br>  super();
 </br>
        System.out.println("Student class Constructor");
    </br>}</br>
}
 
</br>/* Driver program to test*/
class Test</br>
{</br>
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {</br>
        Student s = new Student();</br>
    }</br>
}</br>
Run on IDE
Output:
Person class Constructor
Student class Constructor

Q5.Write the difference between local and remote applet.
                                           </br>Or</br>
How can we pass parameter to an applet.</br>
Answer.</font>
We can create our own applet by own design and embed them into web pages. Local applets are developed in a single system and it is stored in a local system. The web page will search the local system directories, find the local applet and execute it. Execution of local applets doesn't required any internet connection.
Specifying a Local Applet</br>
<applet codebase="path" code="NewApplet.class" width=120 height=120 >
</apple></br>
In the above listing , the codebase attribute specifies a path name on your system for the local applet, whereas the code attribute specifies the name of the byte-code file that contains the applet's code. The path specified in the codebase attribute is relative to the folder containing the HTML document that references the applet.
</br>




An remote applet is that which is developed by someone else and stored on a remote computer connected to the internet.
Specifying a Remote Applet
</br><applet 
codebase="http://www.myconnect.com/applets/" 
code="NewApplet.class" 
width=120 
height=120 >
</applet>
The only difference between Local Applet and Remote Applet is the value of the codebase attribute. In the first case, codebase specifies a local folder, and in the second case, it specifies the URL at which the applet is located.
</br>

Q6. What  is java? What are the features of java and how java works?
                            </br>                             </br>  Or</br>
Explain various types of operation in java.</br>
Answer.</font>
Java is a General Purpose, class based, object oriented, Platform independent, portable, Architecturally neutral, multithreaded, dynamic, distributed, Portable and robust interpreted Programming 

the Java program into Java byte codes. This JVM is then interpreted to run the program.</br>
Other than the above discussed feature, there are a few other remarkable features, like:</br>
</br>Security</br>
Unlike other programming Language where Program interacts with OS using User runtime environment of OS, Java provides an extra layer of security by putting JVM between Program and OS. General Purpose	
Java capabilities are not limited to any specific application domain rather it can be used in various application domain and hence it is called General Purpose Programming Language.
</br>Class based</br>
Java is a class based/oriented programming language which means Java supports inheritance feature of object-oriented Programming Language.
</br>Object oriented</br>
Java is object-oriented means software developed in Java are combination of different types of object.
</br>Platform Independent</br>
A Java code will run on any JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Literally you can run same Java code on Windows JVM, Linux JVM, Mac JVM or any other JVM practically and get same result every ti
</br>Architecturally Neutral</br>
A Java code is not dependent upon Processor Architecture. A Java Application compiled on 64 bit architecture of any platform will run on 32 bit (or any other architecture) system without any issue.
Multithreaded
A thread in Java refers to an independent program. Java supports multithread which means Java is capable of running many tasks simultaneously, sharing the same memory.
Dynamic
Java is a Dynamic programming language which means it executes many programming behavior at Runtime and don’t need to be passed at compile time as in the case of static programming.
Distributed
Java Supports distributed System which means we can access files over Internet just by calling the methods.
Portable
A Java program when compiled produce bytecodes. Bytecodes are magic. These bytecodes can be transferred via network and can be executed by any JVM, hence came the concept of ‘Write once, Run Anywhere(WORA)’.
	
robust programming Language which means it can cope with error while the program is executing as well as keep operating with abnormalities to certain extent.
 Automatic Garbage collection, strong memory management, exception handling and type checking further adds to the list.
Interpreted
Java is a compiled programming Language which compiles
</br>
Java SecuritySimple Syntax
</br>Java is an improved c++ which ensures friendly syntax but with removed unwanted features and inclusion of Automatic Garbage collection.
</br>High Level Programming Language
Java is a High Level Programming Language the syntax of which is human readable. Java lets programmer to concentrate on what to achieve and not how to achieve. The JVM converts a Java Program to Machine understandable language.
High Performance
Java make use of Just-In-Time compiler for high performance. Just-In-Time compiler is a computer program that turns Java byte codes into instructions that can directly be sent to compilers.
</br>History of Java
Java Programming Language was written by James Gosling along with two other person ‘Mike Sheridan‘ and ‘Patrick Naughton‘, while they were working at Sun Microsystems. Initially it was named oak Programming Language.
</br>Java Releases
Initial Java Versions 1.0 and 1.1 was released in the year 1996 for Linux, Solaris, Mac and Windows.
</br>Java version 1.2 (Commonly called as java 2) was released in the year 1998.
</br>Java Version 1.3 codename Kestrel was released in the year 2000.
</br>Java Version 1.4 codename Merlin was released in the year 2002.
</br>Java Version 1.5/Java SE 5 codename ‘Tiger’ was released in the year 2004.
</br>Java Version 1.6/Java SE 6 Codename ‘Mustang’ was released in the year 2006.
</br>Java Version 1.7/Java SE 7 Codename ‘Dolphin’ was released in the year 2011.
</br>Java Version 1.8 is the current stable release which was released this year (2015).
</br>Five Goals which were taken into consideration while developing Java:
</br>Keep it simple, familiar and object oriented.
</br>Keep it Robust and Secure.
</br>Keep it architecture-neural and portable.
</br>Executable with High Performance.
</br>Interpreted, threaded and dynamic.
</br>Why we call it Java 2, Java 5, Java 6, Java 7 and Java 8, not their actual version number which 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8?
Java 1.0 and 1.1 were Java. When Java 1.2 was released it had a lots of changes and marketers/developers wanted a new name so they called it Java 2 (J2SE), remove the numeric before decimal.
This was not the condition when Java 1.3 and Java 1.4 were released hence they were never called Java 3 and Java 4, but they were still Java 2.

<font size="5">Q8.  Write the difference between for loop and while loop with example.</br>
                                                     Or</br>
       Write a program to display grade of the student according to the marks obtained by the student using switch –case statement.</br>
Answer.</font>
 loop and while loop are used to excute one or more lines of code certain number of times. The main differences are as follows.
Syntax:</br>
While loop:</br>
while(condtion) {</br>
//statements to excute.</br>
}</br>
For loop:</br>
for(intialization; condition; Increment or decrement){</br>
// statements to be excuted.</br>
}</br>
There are few variations we can do with for loop.</br>
Such as all three parts of for loop are optional. That means you can also have a loop like this.
for(;;) which is nothing but an infinite loop.</br>
For initialization there can be multiple statements.</br>
for(i =0, j =0;i<20;i++)</br>
Similarly for the third component there can be any expression and not necessarily increment or decrement.
for(i =0;i<10;i =again control goes to check the condition again and if found true then body gets excuted and this goes on untill condition becomes false.
</br>Examples:</br>
while loop:</br>
Let's say that you are making a game, in which you ask the player to input a number, if that number is a positive number,  then the game continues, and you perform some actions inside the body of the loop, but if user enter a zero then it means then user wants to quit the game, so you want to stop the loop. In above scenario, a while loop will be a good choice since you do not know before hand that how many times user wants to execute the loop. Example code is here:
bool continue_game = true;
int choice;</br>
while(continue_game) {
	cin >> choice;</br>
	switch(choice) {</br>
	case 1:</br>
	// do something
	break;</br>
	case 2:</br>
	// do another thing
	break;</br>
	case 0:</br>
	cout << "Thanks for playing!";
	continue_game = false;</br>
	break;</br>
	}</br>
}</br>
2.  for loop:</br>
Lets say that you want to write a program, that takes a digit and gives its table up to 10 times. Then using a for loop will be a good choice, since you already know that loop needs to be executed 10 times. Example code goes here.
#include <iostream></br>
using namespace std;</br>
 
int main() {
	int number;</br>
	cout << "Enter a number" << endl;
	cin >> number;</br>
	for(int multiplier = 1; multiplier <= 10; multiplier++) {
		cout << number << " X " << multiplier << " = " << number * multiplier << endl;
	}</br>
	return 0;</br>
}

Q9.Explain the concept of classes, objects and methods in java.</br>
                                                      Or</br>
Write about naming convention in java.</br>

Answer.</font>
INTRODUCTION TO JAVA CLASSES
A class is nothing but a blueprint or a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. Java class objects exhibit the properties and behaviors defined by its class. A class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object.
Methods are nothing but members of a class that provide a service for an object or perform some business logic. Java fields and member functions names are case sensitive. Current states of a class’s corresponding object are stored in the object’s instance variables. Methods define the operations that can be performed in java programming.
A class has the following general syntax:
   <class modifiers>class<class name>
   <extends clause> <implements clause>{
  // Dealing with Classes (Class body)
   <field declarations (Static and Non-Static)>
   <method declarations (Static and Non-Static)>
   <Inner class declarations>
  <nested interface declarations>
  <constructor declarations>
  <Static initializer blocks>
}</br>
Below is an example showing the Objects and Classes of the Cube class that defines 3 fields namely length, breadth and height. Also the class contains a member function getVolume().
public class Cube {

	</br>int length;
	</br>int breadth;
	</br>int height;
	</br>public int getVolume() {
	</br>	return (length * breadth * height);
	}</br>
}

</br>
</br>CLASS VARIABLES – STATIC FIELDS
</br>We use class variables also know as Static fields when we want to share characteristics across all objects within a class. When you declare a field to be static, only a single instance of the associated variable is created common to all the objects of that class. Hence when one object changes the value of a class variable, it affects all objects of the class. We can access a class variable by using the name of the class, and not necessarily using a reference to an individual object within the class. Static variables can be accessed even though no objects of that class exist. It is declared using static keyword.
</br>CLASS METHODS – STATIC METHODS
Class methods, similar to Class variables can be invoked without having an instance of the class. Class methods are often used to provide global functions for Java programs. For example, methods in the java.lang.Math package are class methods. You cannot call non-static methods from inside a static method.
</br>
FINAL VARIABLE, METHODS AND CLASSES
</br>In Java we can mark fields, methods and classes as final. Once marked as final, these items cannot be changed.
Variables defined in an interface are implicitly final. You can’t change value of a final variable (is a constant). A final class can’t be extended i.e., final class may not be subclassed. This is done for security reasons with basic classes like String and Integer. It also allows the compiler to make some optimizations, and makes thread safety a little easier to achieve. A final method can’t be overridden when its class is inherited. Any attempt to override or hide a final method will result in a compiler error.
INTRODUCTION TO JAVA OBJECTS
The Object Class is the super class for all classes in Java.
Some of the object class methods are
</br>
   equals</br>
   toString()</br>
   wait()</br>
   notify()</br>
   notifyAll()</br>
   hashcode()
 </br> clone()</br>
object is an instance of a class created using a new operator. The new operator returns a reference to a new instance of a class. 
Creating variables of your class type is similar to creating variables of primitive data types, such as integer or float. If you want to create an object of the class and have the reference variable associated with this object, you must also allocate memory for the object by using thenew operator. This process is called instantiating an object or creating an object instance.
When you create a new object, you use the new operator to instantiate the object. The new operator returns the location of the object which you assign o a reference type.
Below is an example showing the creation of Cube objects by using the new operator.
public class Cube {
</br>
	int length = 10;</br>
	int breadth = 10;</br>
	int height = 10;</br>
	public int getVolume() </br>{
	</br>	return (length * breadth * height);
	}</br>
	public static void main(String[] args) {</br>
		Cube cubeObj; // Creates a Cube Reference</br>
		cubeObj = new Cube(); // Creates an Object of Cube</br>
		System.out.println("Volume of Cube is : " + cubeObj.getVolume());</br>
	}
</br><font size="5">
 Q10. How interface can be used to support multiple inheritance. Develop a java program for the example.</br>
                                                                                        Or</br>
What do you understand by multithreading ? what are advantages of multithreading  explain with example.</br>
Answer.</font>
Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior. It is a mechanism for code reuse and to allow independent extensions of the original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a hierarchy. Multiple Inheritance allows a class to have more than one super class and to inherit features from all parent class. it is achieved using interface.
Syntax</br>
public interface A{
	//Do Something
}</br>
public interface B extends A{
	</br>//Do Something
}</br>
public interface C extends A{
	//Do Something
</br>}</br>
Multiple Inheritance Using Interface Example Program
 
interface vehicleone</br>
{</br>
	int  speed=90;</br>
	public void distance();</br>
}
</br>
interface vehicletwo</br>
{</br>
	int distance=100;</br>
	public void speed();</br>
}</br>

class Vehicle  implements vehicleone,vehicletwo</br>
{</br>
	public void distance()</br>
	{</br>
		int  distance=speed*100;</br> 
		System.out.println("distance travelled is "+distance);</br>
	}</br>
	public void speed()</br>
	{</br>
		int speed=distance/100;</br>
	}</br>
}
</br>
